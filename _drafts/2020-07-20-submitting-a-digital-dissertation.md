This past week was the one year anniversary of my PhD defense. I am not entirely sure what has happened to the past 12 months. Job market, pandemic, cross-country moves, toddlers ... such things ate up much of the days (and nights), as they do. 

As I prepare to start my new role as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Religious Studies at the University of Alabama, I thought it would be helpful to (at long last) publish a couple of posts on my experience submitting, creating, and  defending a digital dissertation project. 

Dissertations are a funny creature in the landscape of scholarship. They are a credentialing work, written as a way to learn how and demonstrate that one is able to engage the scholarly community and to do the work of research and analysis. As a result, there is a relatively rigid structure that dissertations are generally expected to follow and there are set processes by which they are entered into the scholarly record (a.k.a., ProQuest and the University Library).

At George Mason, the submission process for dissertations centers around a PDF document. This file, derived from a Word template, is required to follow a standard formatting across all of the University's schools and departments. It contains all of the paratextual elements that make a dissertation a dissertation: dedication, acknowledgements, table of contents, chapters, bibliography, and the like. 





<!-- It is done. In July of this year I successfully defended my [digital dissertation](http://dissertation.jeriwieringa.com/) with the department of History and Art History at George Mason University. 

As digital dissertation projects are still unusual, I thought it would be helpful to describe how I navigated the dissertation submission process in this post, with another post to follow on how I constructed the dissertation.  -->
