She also challenges the idea that, while gender may be a culturally constructed interpretation, sex is natural and naturally binary. Instead, she argues that sex is also constructed, and constructed through the &#8220;apparatus&#8221; of gender (11).</p>

<p>This text is very rich in content and very dense in presentation (which Butler brilliantly defends by noting that language itself is not a neutral medium for conveying meaning). Her conclusion for the challenging of gender binaries is both a recognition that no individual can escape the existing framework or power structures (there is no objective outside place from which one can argue), but that those power structures can be challenged and revealed as arbitrary through subversion, through performing gender in such a way that calls attention to the framework&#8217;s logic and challenges its status as &#8220;natural&#8221; and necessary.</p>
