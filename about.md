I am a phd candidate in history at George Mason University, working on *A Gospel of Health and Salvation: Seventh-day Adventism, Health, Religion, and Gender in American Culture, 1850-1920*. I study digital history and nineteenth-century American religious history.

You can see my work on [Github](http://github.com/jerielizabeth) and on the [Portfolio page](/portfolio). I tweet (occassionally) at [@jerielizabeth](http://twitter.com/jerielizabeth). 

I graduated *summa cum laude* in 2011 with a Master of Arts in Religion from Yale Divinity School and received my Bachelors from Calvin College in 2008 with a double major in Philosophy and English.
