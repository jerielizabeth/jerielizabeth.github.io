## Jeri E. Wieringa, PhD

I am digital historian and an affiliate faculty member with George Mason University. 

I received my PhD in History from George Mason University in 2019 for my digital dissertation, [*A Gospel of Health and Salvation: Modeling the Religious Culture of Seventh-day Adventism, 1843 - 1920*](http://dissertation.jeriwieringa.com/). My scholarship takes place at the intersection of computational and data science methods and American religious history.

You can see my work on [Github](http://github.com/jerielizabeth) and on the [Portfolio page](/portfolio). I tweet [@jerielizabeth](http://twitter.com/jerielizabeth). 

I graduated *summa cum laude* in 2011 with a Master of Arts in Religion from Yale Divinity School and received my Bachelors from Calvin College in 2008 with a double major in Philosophy and English.
