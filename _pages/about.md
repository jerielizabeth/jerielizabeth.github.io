I am digital historian and Assistant Professor in the Department of Religious Studies at The University of Alabama. 

You can see my work on [Github](http://github.com/jerielizabeth) and on the [Portfolio page](/portfolio). I tweet [@jerielizabeth](http://twitter.com/jerielizabeth).

I received my PhD in History from George Mason University in 2019 for my digital dissertation, [*A Gospel of Health and Salvation: Modeling the Religious Culture of Seventh-day Adventism, 1843 - 1920*](http://dissertation.jeriwieringa.com/). My scholarship takes place at the intersection of computational and data science methods and American religious history.

I graduated in 2011 with a Master of Arts in Religion, *summa cum laude*, from Yale Divinity School and received my Bachelors from Calvin College in 2008 with double majors in Philosophy and English.
