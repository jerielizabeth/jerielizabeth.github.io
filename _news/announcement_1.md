I am please to announce that I am [one](https://religion.ua.edu/blog/2020/01/02/rel-adds-new-faculty-member/) of [two](https://religion.ua.edu/blog/2020/08/07/rel-adds-a-new-faculty-member/) new members of the [Department of Religious Studies](https://religion.ua.edu/) at the [University of Alabama](https://www.ua.edu/). I will be teaching [REL 315: Digital Humanities in Religious Studies](https://blogs.religion.ua.edu/rel315/) this fall and am excited to be focusing on questions of data and computational methods in religious studies and the humanities. Roll Tide!
