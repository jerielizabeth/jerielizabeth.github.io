I have new piece published in the *The American Historian* on navigating a digital project through the dissertation process! You can read the online version at [https://www.oah.org/tah/issues/2020/loss-and-learning/beyond-the-pdf-navigating-the-digital-dissertation/](https://www.oah.org/tah/issues/2020/loss-and-learning/beyond-the-pdf-navigating-the-digital-dissertation/).

My strategy was informed by that of Amanda Visconti, who has written on her experience completing a digital dissertation in English. 

If you are interested in more in-depth reflections on digital dissertations in History, there is a piece in the works for Debates in DH, authored by Celeste Sharpe, Zoe LeBlanc, and myself, that does just that!

And thanks to Erin Bush and Celeste Sharpe for feedback on the draft!
