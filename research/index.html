These questions encourage me to look beyond both denominational histories and histories of religious leaders and toward more cultural approaches to the study of religion. They also lend themselves to larger scale projects which require digital methods for exploring patterns over time and the interactions of complex systems.</p><h2>Religious History</h2><p>For my dissertation, I am looking at the intersection of Seventh-day Adventism, health reform movements, and changing gender constructions during the 19th century. The development of Seventh-day Adventism reveals many of the conflicting impulses and ideologies that shaped the lives of nineteenth-century Americans. In combining progressive concerns about women’s health and dress with more conservative notions of domesticity and motherhood; linking salvation to diet, health, and reform but rejecting the predominant Protestant goal of creating heaven on earth; and adapting new medical technologies while insisting on divine guidance in the formation of their practices, Seventh-day Adventism complicates many of the standard narratives of American culture and religion’s place therein. Because of its situation at the intersection of many different religious and cultural traditions of thought, Seventh-day Adventism offers a unique opportunity to investigate the mutually constructing relationship between the religious tenets of a particular community, the constructions and uses of gender, race, and class to designate and contest claims of authority, the links between spiritual and physical fitness, and broader conversations in nineteenth-century America about health and social organization.</p><h2>Digital Humanities</h2><p>I am interested in the ways digital technology changes how humanists model the world, the types of questions that can be asked regarding the human experience, and our collective understanding of what it means to be human. I see these as the central questions for "Digital Humanities" as a field of study, questions that we are only beginning to unpack and explore.</p><p>As a case study for exploring these issues, I am using text-mining and network analysis in my dissertation project to study the publications produced by health reformers and Seventh-day Adventists.</p><h2>Research Posts</h2><ul></ul><li class="archive"><a href="/2014/07/08/Summer-of-Research-Part-1/">Summer of Research, Part I</a></li><li class="archive"><a href="/2014/06/12/lessons-from-dhsi/">All Models are Wrong</a></li><li class="archive"><a href="/2012/05/17/rediscovering-the-humanities-in-digital-humanities/">remembering the humanities in digital humanities</a></li><li class="archive"><a href="/2011/12/23/thoughts-on-scholarship/">Thoughts on Scholarship</a></li><li class="archive"><a href="/2011/02/17/the-perils-of-digitization/">The perils of digitization</a></li><li class="archive"><a href="/2010/02/28/what-i-do-on-sundays-tuesdays-and-wednesday/">What I do on Sundays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays</a></li></article></main><footer><div class="footer-wrapper"><div class="author"><div class="image-wrapper"><a href="/author/"><img alt="author" src="/images/profile2-6c57edfd.jpg" /></a></div></div><div class="copyright"><i class="fa fa-copyright"></i> 2015 <a href="/">From Data to Scholarship</a> - Jeri Wieringa</div></div></footer></body></html>
