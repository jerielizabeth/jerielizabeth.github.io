Personal website developed using the al-folio theme. If you like the design, [head over to the original project](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio)


## Deploying

Because al-folio uses unsupported gems, I've split the deployment and development repos. This folder contains the built website. 

All drafts and the makefile to build and deploy are located in the `[website-source](https://github.com/jerielizabeth/website-source)` repo. 


## License

The theme is available as open source under the terms of the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).

Originally, **al-folio** was based on the [\*folio theme](https://github.com/bogoli/-folio) (published by [Lia Bogoev](http://liabogoev.com) and under the MIT license).
Since then, it got a full re-write of the styles and many additional cool features.
