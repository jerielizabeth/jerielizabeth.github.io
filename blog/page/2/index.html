  <p><em>Gender and the Social Gospel,</em> Wendy Deichmann Edwards and Carolyn De Swarte Gifford, eds.</p>

<p>This series of essays focuses on the lack of attention to women and gender within the historical discourse around the social gospel movement. General topics and themes under consideration include the work of female social gospel leaders, the conservative gender ideas of major leaders, particularly Walter Rauschenbusch, and female theological contributions, albeit through unofficial channels. The commitment to influencing social structures in order to bring about a just (millennial) society, which was sought by both male and female actors, while also being understood differently by them, is emphasized throughout the book.</p>

<p><em>The Gospel of Gentility: American Women Missionaries in Turn-of-the-Century China, </em>Jane Hunter</p>

<p>Hunter’s book is an excellent study of the confluence of religion, gender, race, nationalism, and imperialism that occurred in the lives and actions of women missionaries in China at the turn of the 20th century. The main text of her study focuses on the experiences of American women in China, discussing the different gender expectations and experiences for married and single women, and the uniting desire to recreate an American domestic sphere within the Chinese context. Of particular interest are the ways single women especially found increase authority due to their position outside of the typical gender constructs of both cultures, and their increased tendency to incorporate themselves into Chinese culture.</p>

<hr />

<p>The millennial impulse is alive and well in both of these readings, as we move through the turn of the 20th century. The various actors within the social gospel movement, as highlighted throughout the essays compiled by Edwards and Gifford, are challenging social structures because of a vision of a just social order, a vision equated with the Kingdom of God on earth. The women in Turner’s analysis are also seeking a millennial goal, convinced that once the gospel is preached throughout the world, the end of time would be at hand.</p>

<p>In both of these cases, understandings of gender are central to the vision of society and salvation being pursued. For many of the female advocates of the social gospel, gender equality is central to their idea of a just society, and the conflict between that goal and conservative opinions such as that of Rauschenbusch require further study. On the other side, despite the relatively conservative ideas about gender roles espoused by the missionaries, they saw themselves as bringing liberation to women in China, liberation in the form of domesticity. This liberation of women is tied to their belief that female conversion is instrumental for societal conversion, and so was central to their goal of converting the world for Christ.</p>

<p>While the essays in <em>Gender and the Social Gospel </em>begin the work of reintegrating female actors and questions of gender into the historical narrative, it is clear there is much work left to be done. Because of the variety of ideas and actions pursued under the rubric of affecting social structures to create a just society, definitions are still being negotiated. The social gospel movement, like evangelicalism, is a slippery topic, hard to pin down and classify. Also, the variety of opinions about what constitutes a just society further complicates the issues. A more focused study of gender that focuses on the efforts of people within a particular area or organization intentionally under the rubric of the “Social Gospel” would be a useful follow-up to this more general call for scholarship.</p>

<p>One complaint, or possibility for further work, with Hunter’s analysis is the narrow focus on the goals and experiences of the white missionaries. While her last chapter emphasizes the ways in which Chinese women actively shaped the message they received for their own ends, that line of analysis does not extend throughout the book. Instead, her focus on the missionary experience of gender leaves that aspect of the exchange in need of further development. However, this is more a request for an additional study than a serious complaint with the current.</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/2012/11/28/short-tutorial-cleaning-up-downloaded-files.html">Short Tutorial: Cleaning up downloaded files</a> <span>Nov 28</span></h2>
  <!-- use article.summary(250) if you have Nokogiri available to show just
       the first 250 characters -->
  <p>So you used wget or Python to pull down a collection of files from the web. Excellent! But in looking through your loot, you notice that a number of the files are oddly small and, on further examination, find that they are functionally empty. How do you clean up your collection of files quickly?</p>

<p>There are a number of very powerful command line tools built into UNIX systems (Mac and Linux) that allow you to manipulate your files quickly and easily. This is a brief tutorial on how to use those tools to locate all of the files that are too small and then remove those files from your collection.</p>

<p>Begin by navigating in Terminal to your collection of folders. For example, my files were located a couple of folders downs within my Documents folder.</p>

<pre>cd Documents/Github/Clio3/Webscraping/hymn-files</pre>

<p>Once in the folder with your downloaded files, you need to find a way to isolate out the files that are too small to be interesting. To do this, use the “find” command.</p>

<p>If the files we are interested in sorting through are all one file type (in my case they’re .json files), we can tell the computer to find all of the files of a particular type and particular size as follows:</p>

<pre>find *.json -size 28c</pre>

<p>This would find all of the json files that are 28 bytes in size.</p>

<p>However, we want all the files that are 28 bytes or less.</p>

<pre>find *.json -size -28c</pre>

<p>This is important in my case because the files are not truly empty. There is a simple way to identify truly empty files, if that is more appropriate for your data.</p>

<pre>find *.json -empty</pre>

<p>You can also add</p>

<pre>-maxdepth 1</pre>

<p>if there are additional folders that you do not want to work through.</p>

<p>Finding the files is great, but now we need to do something with that collection of files.</p>

<p>There are two ways you can do this. First, you can simply add a delete option to your command, as follows</p>

<pre>find *.json -size -28c -delete</pre>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>In general, this should work. However, if you are dealing with a large number of files, it is often better to use a pipe (“</td>
      <td>”). The pipe takes the results of the first command and feeds them to the second command. In the example below, we are taking the results of the find command and passing them to the remove command (“rm”).</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<pre>find *.json -size -28c | xargs rm</pre>

<p>You will notice that we included “xargs” on the right side of the pipe. Xargs helps the computer handle a long list of file names.</p>

<p>Note: The Wikipedia entry on xargs suggests using “-0″ (zero) when dealing with file names with spaces in them as xargs defaults to separating at white space (another reason to avoid spaces in filenames). If you run this command without -0 and it doesn’t work, try adding the -0.</p>

<p>And the command we are running on each filename is “rm” or remove. rm has a number of options that you can research, some of which really make data un-recoverable and should be used with care. However, a basic “rm” command will be sufficient for this example.</p>

<p>Run this command to remove all of the files less than 28 bytes from your current directory.</p>

<p>(I used 28 bytes because the computer was having trouble with 0 and all of the files I wanted to keep were larger than 28 bytes. Not exactly sure why 0 was a problem but this is why experimenting with the find options before moving on to removing the files is a good idea!)</p>

  <p>Maureen Fitzgerald, <em>Habits of Compassion</em></p>

<p><em>Habits of Compassion </em>looks at the history of relief work in New York city by focusing on the efforts of Irish Catholic nuns, a focus that is part of a larger effort to address the tendency in women’s history to give insufficient attention to the ways “non-dominant cultures and poor women” influenced the efforts of the dominant culture (7). She highlights the competing gender systems between the Irish nuns and the Protestant reform workers and argues that the eventual adoption of scientific charity by Catholics is the largest loss to the general discourse about poverty and relief.</p>

<p>Karla Goldman, <em>Beyond the Synagogue Gallery</em></p>

<p>Goldman examines the changing discourse around role and place of women in Jewish life by examining the changes in the physical space women occupied and the debates surrounding those changes. The study is brilliantly conceived and offer a particularly useful example of how, despite little written that directly discusses women, this issue of physical space makes the surrounding conversation apparent. Goldman traces the changes largely to efforts within the Jewish community to gain respectability and to incorporate, in some ways at least, Victorian ideas about female religiosity. The adoption of family pews and the end of the female balcony coincides with increasingly rigid understandings of gender roles and an increased focus on the domestic sphere for women.</p>

<p>Kathleen Sprows Cummings, <em>New Women of the Old Faith</em></p>

<p>Cummings’ book is a study of four Catholic women as a way of discussing in a more nuanced way Catholic reactions to the “New Woman” of the early 20th century. Her project is to show how, despite harsh criticism, Catholic women used various strategies to claim some of the ideas promoted by “New Women” and reframe them within the Catholic faith. She looks at efforts to promote educational opportunities for women and the efforts to use Catholic women of the past to claim a powerful role for women within the Church. Her last chapter focuses on reclaiming the rhetoric of Katherine Conway, best known for her anti-suffrage campaigns. She argues that strong feminist beliefs, though different than those guiding those working for suffrage, guided Conway’s argument against the vote and that she should be seen as a much more complex figure than she is usually portrayed.</p>

<hr />

<p>A couple of thoughts and concerns for discussion:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Fitzgerald also discusses Jewish efforts to provide their own relief for children and the poor. However, the main discussion in the book is the interaction between Catholic and Protestant organizations and individual people, so that this inclusion feels more like a bulstering of the arguments about Catholics than a sustained analysis. At the same time, expanding to a more thorough discussion of Jewish poverty relief would make the book unwieldy. I would like the think through that balance of bringing additional voices into the narrative in a productive way while also maintaining a well defined project.</li>
</ul>

<div>
  <span style="font-size: medium;"><br /> </span>
</div>

<ul>
  <li>A couple of little questions for Goldman. For one, her discussion on 192 about membership being granted to women only beginning around 1895 leaves me wondering what is required for membership in her discussion. She compares evangelical groups who also excluded women from leadership and voting roles, however, in these groups membership is understood differently – one can be a member and can be disciplined as one even without the ability to vote about administrative issues. Also, I am curious about pews. While she doesn’t address it, in one of the examples, pews were brought in as part of the reforming changes. It is not really important to the argument, but always interesting to me that sitting in pews is itself an innovation in religious practice, though one that occurs at different times for different traditions.</li>
</ul>

<div>
  <span style="font-size: medium;"><br /> </span>
</div>

<ul>
  <li>While I think I understand what “Americanism” is from the reading, it would be helpful to discuss this more. I was unaware of this controversy.</li>
</ul>

<div>
  <span style="font-size: medium;"><br /> </span>
</div>

<ul>
  <li>While I enjoyed Cummings analysis (though I wish the structure was different), the last paragraph of her introduction left me concerned. She is arguing here that religion plays a central role in religious people’s construction of identity. And yet she alludes that religion was less influential in the response to second wave feminism. With not knowing very well the history that she is alluding to, this seems to be a large, and unnecessary, step back from her framing claims about the necessity of taking religion seriously as a key influence, along with race, class, and gender, in identity formation.</li>
</ul>

  <p>We are a bit eclectic this week.</p>

<p>Michael Stephens, <em>Who Healeth All Thy Diseases: Health, Healing, and Holiness in the Church of God Reformation Movement</em>.</p>

<p>Stephens examines the history of healing within the Church of God (Anderson) movement, arguing that despite the lack of scholarly attention, healing practices were central to the development of the denomination and of American Protestantism in general. The focus is largely on major figures within the denomination, particularly Daniel Sidney Warner, Enoch E. Byrum, Charles Wesley Naylor, and the Gospel Trumpet Company publications. Stephens traces the changing attitudes toward healing, from viewing healing as the particular sign of sanctification to a repudiation of all medical intervention to a moderate stance, while highlighting the adoption of popular health reform prescriptions as part of the healthy Christian life.</p>

<p>Evelyn Brooks Higginbotham, <em>Righteous Discontent: The Women’s Movement in the Black Baptist Church, 1880-1920.</em></p>

<p>Higginbotham takes up the challenge of writing a history that focuses on women and gender while also arguing for the centrality of women and the construction of gender to the creation of society. She argues that the black church is the “product and process of male and female interaction” and that a focus on “the ministry” misses half of the conversation (2). She deploys the analytical frameworks of Benedict Anderson and Habermas, describing the creation of the church as a “public sphere” and central to “imagined community” of black society. As Higginbotham deftly shows, both the imagined community and the public sphere were contested and shifting and she focuses on the interactions of race, class, and gender to reveal the different discourses in play in shaping the community.</p>

<p>Joycelyn Moody, <em>Sentimental Confessions: Spiritual Narratives of Nineteenth-Century African American Women.</em></p>

<p>*Sentimental Confessions *is a recovery project focused on reclaiming the black women’s spiritual autobiographies as works of theological importance and as rhetorically powerful and significant texts. Moody is interacting with scholarship on sentimentalism and women’s writing during the 19th-century, arguing against the tradition of Ann Douglas and for the idea that sentimental writing falls within the long tradition of religious writing that is embodied, sensual, and emotionally potent. The individual chapters focus more on close readings of the texts themselves and provide little additional historical context. The framing of this text is most interesting for historical projects that work with these and other such primary sources.</p>

<p>Edith Blumhofer, <em>Restoring the Faith: The Assemblies of God, Pentecostalism, and American Culture</em>.</p>

<p><em>Restoring the Faith</em> is an institutional history of the Assemblies of God denomination. Blumhofer traces a historical arch that begins with the restorationist impulse to return the church to the example of the New Testament, that moves through a period of growth and acculturation, and ends at a present day that has become something other than its primitivist beginnings, that has “succumbed to aspects of modernity” that it began in opposition to (12). Her history focuses more on Parham than Seymour, more on the white Pentecostal experience than African-American or Hispanic experiences, and while she does address some questions of women in leadership positions in the Assemblies of God denomination, how gender is constructed and negotiated is not the focus of her study. The book provides a useful overview and reference for some of the major moments and figures in the institutional history of the Assemblies of God.</p>

<p>Elizabeth Elkin Grammer, <em>Some Wild Visions: Autobiographies of Female Itinerant Evangelists in Nineteenth-Century America.</em></p>

<p>Grammer’s text is a literary study of the autobiographies of 7 female itinerant preachers: Nancy Towle, Jarena Lee, Zilpha Elaw, Lydia Sexton, Laura Haviland, Julia Foote, and Amanda Smith. In analyzing their self-presentation, Grammer focuses on 4 shared characteristics these autobiographies share and seeks to interpret the role and experience of these female itinerants on the basis of those shared characteristics. She notes a shared conscious leaving of the domestic space and the ideal of domesticity, and even an intentional “mis-reading” of that ideal so as to allow them to claim the world as their domestic space (56). She notes that they take part in the more “masculine” culture of “competitive individualism and accounting,” listing for readers the preaching engagements held and the number of converts attained (70). She notes that they were largely alone and also saw themselves as separate in some way from the general culture. And finally she comments upon a shared style in autobiographical writing and the lack of clear ordering or narrative that marks all of these texts. Her work studies how these women combined competing paradigms of “domesticity … individual assertion and competitiveness… and reluctant prophet and suffering savior” to “inhabit and subvert many assumptions about gender, race, and class” (23).</p>

<hr />

<p>More questions and thoughts than synthesis this week.</p>

<p>One of the interesting methodological questions I have coming out of these readings is the question of dealing with women and women’s organizations as a group and focusing on individual women within religious movements. Moody and Higginbotham take two different approaches to this – Moody, because of her focus on the autobiography, looks at the rhetoric of 6 individual women writers while Higginbotham looks at women’s organizations within the Black Baptist church and how those organizations influenced the overall institution. While I see Higginbotham’s point that only studying individual women often leaves them still outside of the larger narrative about society and culture, how does one deal responsibly (avoid generalizations, etc) when telling the history of a group.</p>

<p>Grammer notes that “revival” is a dominant theme throughout the 19th century. However, in reading her and other texts, it seems that the millennium is perhaps the stronger theme, driving even revival itself. Revival for the sake of revival does not seem strong enough to move so many people in so many extraordinary directions. However, and this is pulling from Abzug as well, the firm belief in the coming millennium seems like it could be enough to provoke the slew of revivals and reform efforts that we see.</p>

<p>Both Moody and Grammer are interested in using these text, which on the surface seem to restate rather than challenge cultural ideologies, to uncover how individual women negotiated and challenged those ideologies. Grammer’s text in general offers some very interesting and instructive ways of readings these texts – I need to return to this text for a closer reading. And Moody quotes Sharon Harris to argue that even texts that do perpetuate dominant ideology are worthy of study, as they are sites where ideologies are interacted with, help us understand the conditions under which the text was produced and also often contain subversions of those ideologies (181). Both of these are useful resources for thinking about how to deal with these texts going further.</p>

<p>While neither Stephens nor Blumhofer ignore women in their histories, it is clear that the focus of investigation is the institution and the (generally) male leaders who lead and influenced those institutions. On the one hand, this doesn’t seem unreasonable – the institution and its records is largely controlled by the male leadership. However, Higginbotham seems to offer a solid critique of this approach by arguing that it is the interactions between male and female individuals and groups that create the larger culture and institution. Can Higginbotham’s approach be applied further? Can it be argued that one cannot understand any religious group apart from the ongoing conversations and negotiations between female auxiliary organizations and the traditionally male controlled hierarchy (in whatever form that takes)?</p>
