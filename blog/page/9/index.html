  <p>I have hit the point when perfectionism becomes counter-productive and so am declaring my final project done.</p>

<p>The design has been modified from the earlier draft. I replaced the border with a drop shadow and gave the header image a thorough re-thinking. The structure of the site is largely the same, but I added an Omeka install to preview the document viewing, the search functions, and the browsing options. After researching CMS options, it seems that the best option for both the management of the documents and the blogging/forum functions of the site is to do a combination of WordPress and Omeka. This, however, would result in a complicated site to maintain and some of the desired functions may need to be rethought. The project for the summer is working with Richard to import all of the documents into the database and to move the site onto his servers.</p>

<p>My final project is available at <a href="http://jeriwieringa.com/projectcanterbury">www.jeriwieringa.com/projectcanterbury</a>.</p>

  <p>My design assignment is <a href="http://www.jeriwieringa.com/portfolio/design.html">live</a>. There is a brief description to provide some context as part of the page, but the gist is that the design is to go over a wordpress installation. As such, many of the links and the search do not work yet! Mea Culpa.</p>

  <p>“The Lost Museum” digital exhibit and Josh Brown’s discussion of it and other digital projects that CHNM and other organizations have put together brought me back to <a title="William Thomas, &quot;The Differences Slavery Made&quot;" href="http://digitalhistory.unl.edu/essays/thomasessay.php">“The Differences Slavery Made: A Close Analysis of Two American Communities”</a> by William Thomas, which we read in Clio1 in the fall. In this piece, Thomas discusses the process of creating a “digital article,” a piece of scholarship that started with the structure of the web, rather than the structure of the journal article. In the fall, we discussed the original web <a title="&quot;The Differences Slavery Made&quot; digital &quot;article&quot;" href="http://www2.vcdh.virginia.edu/AHR/">“article”</a> and its goals, successes, and failures. While the idea of creating an article that rethinks the process of scholarship from the ground up is good and necessary, “The Differences Slavery Made” is a persuasive piece of evidence that we have not yet figured out what exactly that means or how to make such a work that is effective and accessible.</p>

<p>“The Lost Museum,” while interesting (though I had trouble with flash and couldn’t continue the mystery past the second room) is another early example of experiments in digital exhibits and collections. It has its quirks but it is an engaging attempt.</p>

<p>However, these early examples are not exciting to me because of what they are. They are exciting because they show very clearly how much innovation has already taken place and how much room there is for more creative thinking and experimentation. The flaws in these pieces are not important, other than as reminders of what didn’t not work. What is important is communicating information and making arguments, and it seems to me that these pieces are good reminders that there is a lot of room for finding new and engaging ways of doing that digitally. These exhibits and articles are inspirations points, because they represent a willingness to innovate and a challenge to be worked on.</p>

<p>Failure is just a chance to learn and try again. And these opportunities to try and fail and learn are why digital history is so exciting!</p>

  <p>The readings for this week focused on creating visual hierarchies between the various elements of ones site, which creates the argument structure of a website. While I had been thinking of information architecture in terms of the back-end of the website, it was good to be reminded to focus on the visual organization of information and the visual coding given to pieces of information. As <a title="Jakob Nielsen, &quot;Guidelines for Visualizing Links&quot;" href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20040510.html">Jakob Nielsen’s piece</a> argued, while there are many inventive things one can do with design, there are simply some things which make the user-experience more difficult. By doing such things as signaling links in consistent and expected manners, you can increase the usability and effectiveness of your site for a broader audience. <a title="Luke Wroblewski, &quot; Visible Narratives: Understanding Visual Organization&quot;" href="http://www.boxesandarrows.com/view/visible_narratives_understanding_visual_organization">Luke Wroblewski also offered a good reminder</a> that, for effective visual narratives, the most important elements of the website should be visually coded as such, by position on the page, by size, and by relationship to other elements.</p>

<p>The <a title="Hans Rosling, &quot;Hans Rosling shows the best stats you've ever seen&quot;" href="http://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_shows_the_best_stats_you_ve_ever_seen.html">TED video of Hans Rosling</a> illustrates very clearly the value of well done visual design. I found his visualizations to be very compelling and the software he has created seems extraordinarily powerful for allowing users both to trace large-scale trends and to gain greater clarity by breaking down the data into more detailed visualizations. I think this type of dynamic visualization is an under-utilized approach to public history on the web and one that offers a lot of potential for enabling the kind of creative, read-write, engagement that <a title="Larry Lessig, &quot;Larry Lessig on laws that choke creativity&quot;" href="http://www.ted.com/talks/larry_lessig_says_the_law_is_strangling_creativity.html">Larry Lessig promoted in his TED talk</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, it was helpful to look again at <em>White Space is not your enemy.</em> Some of the design sins were starting to creep into my mock-ups for the design/final projects (but I like centering…) so it was good to be pushed back out of those ruts.</p>

<p>One point I keep coming back to is that design is continually evolving, both because I am never “done” with a design, and because the  community’s ideas and standards about design are also in flux. The aesthetic expectations and standards against which design work is judged shift, which means work must also be updated to keep from becoming visually outdated. At least the modular approach that using an external style sheet provides means that the content can be separated from the design, reducing the amount of work that needs to be reworked over time to keep my designs visually compelling.</p>

<p>**Addendum: **I posted on <a title="Sheri Huerta, &quot;Smoozing the Audience through Creative Technology and Structured Access to Information&quot;" href="http://shuerta1.wordpress.com/2012/03/31/smoozing/">Sheri’s blog</a> this week.</p>

  <p>Accessibility and visual arguments. While there was some debate as to whether the Tufte piece was indeed on the list for today, I found the combination of Tufte with the accessibility pieces to be productive. Much of the reading on accessibility dealt with the needs of visually impaired, blind, or mobility impaired users. These users require the information on websites to be organized logically and  well annotated. And the tips for creating websites that are sensitive to the needs of these users were very helpful and seem relatively easy, if perhaps time consuming, to implement.</p>

<p>There is a high emphasis on text and textual information in the accessibility pieces. And yet, there are other users who will understand visual arguments more easily than textual arguments. Tufte’s instructions on well-crafted visual argumentation provided helpful guidelines for creating visual pieces that argue well for a particular position or interpretation. But, then, how does the creator also provide access to that visual argument for users who cannot see it?</p>

<p>I really enjoyed the Tufte text, particularly chapters 4-7. But then, I am fond of anyone who quotes Salmon Rushdie. As someone with minimal artistic training, I know well the impulse to over label. The reminder to simplify and to focus on clarity of presentation was a good one. I was particularly interested in Tufte’s endorsement of confections and juxtaposition. I was not expecting this form of visual argument to be promoted. Perhaps because my impression of confections is that they are old and complex, a collection of symbols that can be more than challenging to interpret. The confection is an argument by association and layering and a simplification of the confection is a powerful form of visual argument. His example of El Lissitzky’s self portrait is one such simplification, layering symbols but each symbol remains distinct, thus retaining it’s individual symbolic function.</p>

<p>Images like Lissitzky’s cannot be communicated easily or well in words, making it accessible to someone who is blind or has impaired vision would be challenging. It is an interesting challenge to balance the visual nature of the web and the need to be aware of the broader audience.</p>

<p>The readings for the week reminded me of the need to be aware of and sensitive to the needs of users who have various disabilities. Making websites that are more easily read by screen readers and other adaptive technologies is labor intensive, but seems to me that it also results in more semantically rich html. But not all visual arguments can be effectively annotated. It may be the case that some arguments will need to be made twice – once visually and once textually – offering parallel arguments to increase the accessibility of the information.</p>

<p><strong>Tools:</strong></p>

<p>Since Megan already mentioned the Chrome development tool, I should tip my hat to firebug for firefox. It is very handy, though I am afraid my browser is becoming a bit bloated with addons.</p>

<p>For those who are interested in other tools for hand-coding website, I am using a trial version of <a title="Link to Coda by Panic, web development software" href="http://www.panic.com/coda/">Coda by Panic</a> and really like it. It is a text editor, CSS editor, file-transfer tool, generates previews, and a number of other things that I haven’t even tapped yet. It is well priced, given everything it offers, but isn’t cheap, which is its main drawback.</p>

<p>One more, but I am still figuring this out. I have been attempting to use <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a> for some of my development, as it provides an easy way to create backups and provides version control.</p>

<p>**Update: **I commented on <a href="http://objectfiles.wordpress.com/2012/03/26/1910/#comment-43">Beth’s post</a>.</p>
