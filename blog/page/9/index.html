  <p>As part of <a href="http://fredgibbs.net/courses/digital-history-techne/">History 698</a>, currently named “Programming for Historians,” we are creating tutorials for <a href="http://programminghistorian.org/">programminghistorian.org</a>. I will be posting my tutorials here, along with reflections on the process of applying data manipulation to historical investigation.</p>

<p>Expect tutorials on web scrapping and on text mining in the coming months.</p>

<p>To follow my coding efforts, go to <a href="http://jeriwieringa.com/dev/">jeriwieringa.com/dev</a>.</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/2012/05/17/rediscovering-the-humanities-in-digital-humanities.html">remembering the humanities in digital humanities</a>, <span>17 May 2012</span></h2>
  <!-- use article.summary(250) if you have Nokogiri available to show just

  <p>I was asked a question recently that I wasn’t expecting. I was asked by a ruby developer what could be learned from the past. It was a sincere question. But I realized when he asked it that I generally assume the value of historical inquiry. I assume that you can learn a lot from the past, it just depends on what questions you ask.</p>

<p>But to go further, the question he was asking wasn’t simply, “is there any value in studying history?” It was, what can we, the community of developers and entrapreneurs, learn from the practice of history and from studying our history.</p>

<p>That’s when it struck me – we spend a lot of time in the digital humanities talking about using digital tools and methodologies for studying the past. Which is good. But we don’t spend nearly as much time talking about what the humanities brings to this partnership. Perhaps that is because we assume we know what it is. Or perhaps we are unsure ourselves.</p>

<p>Humanities scholars do bring something, and it’s more than the cultural “raw material” for study. We bring questions, questions about persons and community, questions that help focus attention on structures of power, on the formation of identity, on links between peoples and patterns across events. Questions that highlight contingency and thereby open up opportunities for change.</p>

<p>I find that many people who work in digital production find the concept of the digital humanities intriguing. I also find the question of “so what can you tell us” to be prevalent, a question that, as someone who prefers to study 19th-century religion, I am not sure how to answer.</p>

<p>It would be an interesting experiment to apply the questions and methodologies I want to use for studying the past to study the recent past. It would also be terrifying, because, well, dead people don’t talk back, and that’s comforting. But it would be instructive to see if the story constructed using humanities and digital analysis tracks with and can shed new light on the story this particular community tells itself.</p>

<p>(I just remembered that this is what people who do ethnographic research do all the time. Yay! People who can help!)</p>

<p>I am intrigued by the idea of claiming questions, or a particular mode of inquiry, as the contribution that the humanities brings to this discussion. While the technology is important and digital humanities scholars should not be content with black boxes or giving conceptual direction without getting their hands “dirty” (more on this later), we should not loose site of the humanities in the digital.</p>

<p>So what can a humanities scholar offer a community of developers? Perhaps a story. A story that helps reveal metanarratives – the assumptions about their community and the stories they tell themselves about their place in the world. A story that helps start conversations about where to go next as a community of practice.</p>

  <p>I have hit the point when perfectionism becomes counter-productive and so am declaring my final project done.</p>

<p>The design has been modified from the earlier draft. I replaced the border with a drop shadow and gave the header image a thorough re-thinking. The structure of the site is largely the same, but I added an Omeka install to preview the document viewing, the search functions, and the browsing options. After researching CMS options, it seems that the best option for both the management of the documents and the blogging/forum functions of the site is to do a combination of WordPress and Omeka. This, however, would result in a complicated site to maintain and some of the desired functions may need to be rethought. The project for the summer is working with Richard to import all of the documents into the database and to move the site onto his servers.</p>

<p>My final project is available at <a href="http://jeriwieringa.com/projectcanterbury">www.jeriwieringa.com/projectcanterbury</a>.</p>

  <p>My design assignment is <a href="http://www.jeriwieringa.com/portfolio/design.html">live</a>. There is a brief description to provide some context as part of the page, but the gist is that the design is to go over a wordpress installation. As such, many of the links and the search do not work yet! Mea Culpa.</p>

  <p>“The Lost Museum” digital exhibit and Josh Brown’s discussion of it and other digital projects that CHNM and other organizations have put together brought me back to <a title="William Thomas, &quot;The Differences Slavery Made&quot;" href="http://digitalhistory.unl.edu/essays/thomasessay.php">“The Differences Slavery Made: A Close Analysis of Two American Communities”</a> by William Thomas, which we read in Clio1 in the fall. In this piece, Thomas discusses the process of creating a “digital article,” a piece of scholarship that started with the structure of the web, rather than the structure of the journal article. In the fall, we discussed the original web <a title="&quot;The Differences Slavery Made&quot; digital &quot;article&quot;" href="http://www2.vcdh.virginia.edu/AHR/">“article”</a> and its goals, successes, and failures. While the idea of creating an article that rethinks the process of scholarship from the ground up is good and necessary, “The Differences Slavery Made” is a persuasive piece of evidence that we have not yet figured out what exactly that means or how to make such a work that is effective and accessible.</p>

<p>“The Lost Museum,” while interesting (though I had trouble with flash and couldn’t continue the mystery past the second room) is another early example of experiments in digital exhibits and collections. It has its quirks but it is an engaging attempt.</p>

<p>However, these early examples are not exciting to me because of what they are. They are exciting because they show very clearly how much innovation has already taken place and how much room there is for more creative thinking and experimentation. The flaws in these pieces are not important, other than as reminders of what didn’t not work. What is important is communicating information and making arguments, and it seems to me that these pieces are good reminders that there is a lot of room for finding new and engaging ways of doing that digitally. These exhibits and articles are inspirations points, because they represent a willingness to innovate and a challenge to be worked on.</p>

<p>Failure is just a chance to learn and try again. And these opportunities to try and fail and learn are why digital history is so exciting!</p>
