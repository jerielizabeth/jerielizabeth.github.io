  <p>This weeks readings focused on the creation and evaluation of digital scholarship. Both the type of work being created and the ways that work is evaluated differ from what has become the standards for academic production and for tenure and promotion.</p>

<p>Looking at the creation of digital scholarship, William Thomas’ “<a title="Writing a digital history article" href="http://digitalhistory.unl.edu//essays/thomasessay.php">Writing a Digital History Article From Scratch</a>” provides in informative reflection on the process of creating something new. Two pieces that I found very interesting and discussion worthy come from Thomas’ use of Mindy McAdams and Stephanie Berger’s work in the <em>Journal of Electronic Publishing</em>. The first is the claim:</p>

<p>“We defend two arguments here,” they began, “1. The writer does not give up control in hypertext. 2. The reader has always had a large degree of control. If the reader’s experience of agency is heightened in hypertext narratives, does it follow that the writer relinquishes authority over the text? That’s the control paradox: We contend that the author gives up very little—perhaps nothing at all.”</p>

<p>This claim hits to the heart of one of the concerns repeatedly expressed about creating digital arguments – the concern that we cannot control the interpretation of non-linear arguments. I have hinted at my concern that control over linear arguments might be something of a false security. Here McAdams and Berger take another approach to the question – while the reader has control, the author still has authority over the text. Just as in print, the author of a website still sets the parameters, still presents the argument, still chooses the evidence and how to link those pieces of evidence. Thinking back to last week and Manovich’s distinction between open and closed interactivity, a digital scholarly article is a great example of a closed interactive piece, and rightly so. The author chooses the information being considered, the hyper-link connections between those pieces of information and the like. I think our concern about being unable to control the audience’s experience with our digital “texts” is a red herring, both in the sense that we both have more control over the digital material than we realize and in the sense that we have less control over the print material than we hope.</p>

<p>The second claims: “McAdams and Berger explained that electronic text and narrative could not be written in the same way as print text and that this difference could not be reverse engineered. In other words we could not write in the standard way for print publication and then cut the text up for digital publication or vice versa. “‘Broken apart’ is perhaps a poor metaphor,” they warned, “it implies a whole that has been damaged. We assert that components ideally are written discretely as components from the very beginning of the process. Extracting components from a pre-existing unilinear text not only proves to be equally (or more) difficult but also appears to produce inferior components.”</p>

<p>Thomas agrees with this opinion and so crafts his digital article in a way that is entirely different than a print article, though using many of the same broad categories of information. Just as in a print article, the site has pieces of evidence, supporting pieces of historiography, and connections between those pieces of information being made by the author. I spent a good amount of time poking around the actual site (<a title="The Difference Slavery Made" href="http://www2.vcdh.virginia.edu/AHR/" target="_blank">The Difference Slavery Made</a>) and it was quite thought provoking in its non-linearity. Each item could be accessed from multiple directions, with each piece of evidence corresponding with pieces of historiography and with its place within the argument of the article. To grasp what Thomas, et al are arguing, the site actually requires a large amount of focused attention, something that is not always the case for the print article. Because of its organization, the site requires the reader to be very active and to navigate through the material intentionally. This is a very interesting and challenging picture of what the digital article could be.</p>

<p><a title="Tenure, promotion and public history" href="http://ncph.org/cms/careers-training/" target="_blank">“Tenure, Promotion, and the Publicly Engaged Academic Historian,”</a> is a study that I found very encouraging when I was applying for programs with the intention of focusing on digital creations. It will be interesting to see how many of the recommendations will be implemented by universities, but it is exciting to see that this conversation is already well under-way before those of us in the class hit the academic job market.</p>

<p>One final thing I wanted to draw attention to from this weeks reading was the difference in the state, or at least the description of the state, of a cyberinfrastructure between “Our Cultural Commonwealth” in 2006 and “<a href="http://www.clir.org/pubs/execsum/sum145.html" target="_blank">Working Together or Apart:Promoting the Next Generation of Digital Scholarship</a>” in 2009. Where “Our Cultural Commonwealth” offers a plea for serious investment in a digital infrastructure, both for the preservation of cultural items and for the expansions of scholarship, “Working Together” speaks of inheriting “a cyberinfrastructure of systems, data, and services” from the sciences and the need for over-all coherence in infrastructure (1, 12). While I understand and appreciate the desire and need to create digital works that can communicate with one another and can be used by others, the effort to create a coherent infrastructure, as we have discussed in other classes, is challenging and costly. To what extent does infrastructure come out of projects and to what extent is infrastructure necessary precondition for projects? And do we need to rely on grants and similar funding models to create infrastructure and projects? As noted in “Our Cultural Commonwealth,” there has been little contribution to infrastructure for work in digital humanities and, given the current political climate, looking for federal support seems to be problematic or at least unreliable. How can we create digital scholarship in ways that are beneficial to the community and that are sustainable?</p>

  <ul>
  <li>What is your inquiry question? What do you want your users to learn?</li>
</ul>

<p>My inquiry questions are “How does space shape religious history and how has religious history shaped space?” and “Can a spatial study of religion point to questions that we have yet thought to ask?” I want my user to come away with a sense of the complexity of the religious landscape, new questions about why certain patterns seem to emerge, and an interest in questions of space as something to be questioned not assumed.</p>

<ul>
  <li>What is your methodological stance?</li>
</ul>

<p>Methodologically, I have chosen to make “place” or location my primary unit of analysis, in order to move away from denominations as the basic unit of religious history, and to point to the importance of location in the development of religious practices and beliefs.</p>

<ul>
  <li>How does your design work to support these goals?</li>
</ul>

<p>Omeka allows for me to create “place” as an item type, thereby making “place” the fundamental building block of my collections and exhibits.</p>

<ul>
  <li>What new things do you need to learn?</li>
</ul>

<p>There are so many new things to learn. I need to learn much about Native American religious practices. I need to learn how to use the Timeline plugin in Omeka. I need to learn how to create my search page. I need to figure out how to define Dublin Core terms… oh dear.</p>

<ul>
  <li>How will you go about learning these things?</li>
</ul>

<p>Collaboration! I will solicit contributions from tribal organizations in Connecticut. I will make friends with people who know more about the technical end of Omeka. And I will do a lot of reading.</p>

<ul>
  <li>What is the rational for the decisions you’re making about source choices (by type, collection, time period, etc.)?</li>
</ul>

<p>This is further defended in my application, but I have chosen Connecticut as a geographic area because of size, and because I know where to look for resources. I have chosen the time period to cover the period of the establishment of the Congregational Church, as well as Native American religious practice prior to colonization. I have chosen not to limit by religious type, because doing so would reinforce longstanding cultural biases and would deprive the resource of its desired complexity. I have chosen to organize by place, rather than by denomination, to draw attention to places where denominational boundaries fail to provide answers. And I have chosen to focus on geolocation to draw attention to space as a mode of historical inquiry.</p>

<ul>
  <li>What questions remain for you to provide a convincing grant application?</li>
</ul>

<p>For the application to be convincing, the narrative needs to draw the reader in and effectively communicate why such a project is useful and why it is important to the reader. I hope that my application communicates my idea well enough and stresses its significance sufficiently to inspire the committee to invest in the project.<br />
And with that, here is my final draft. Thank you everyone for the feedback! It has been very helpful in refining the ideas behind this project.</p>

  <p>Oh, for one more week with this text. Well, if I’m dreaming, a month with just this text would be better <img src="http://jeriwieringa.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>

<p>I really enjoyed this text. I have run out of time to write a well-reasoned post, so I will write more after class.</p>

<p>However, one point that Manovich makes repeatedly in the text that I found particularly helpful for our work is the question of interactivity and the question of freedom. Manovich notes, very helpfully, that all cultural products are interactive and that we must remember psychological interactivity as a way that we interact with cultural products. One of the key aspects of engaging with art or cultural products is the associations we draw. I also really appreciated his distinction between open and closed interactivity. Where art allows us to draw whatever associations we may draw (open), there is a real danger in digital work to confuse closed interactivity with open. Merely allowing the user to choose between a number of predetermined options (closed) is not the same as open interactivity. Instead, there is an imposition here of the mind of the creator on the user. The same exists when using the OS or using software to create a 3D object – while the user is free to choose between options, those options are preexisting and imposed. It is important to realize this and to realize that engaging with such objects does limit the ways we can view the world and the things we can create.</p>

<p><strong>[Update] The promised “more” after class is just not going to happen. Sadness.</strong></p>

  <p>Hi all,</p>

<p>Here is a <a href="http://prezi.com/2oxy661om5uo/mapping-spaces-2/?auth_key=b37e39b47740a439274b8b59e5ca3cd14b71d0b8">sneak-peak</a> of my Prezi presentation for tonight!</p>

<p>Also, the <a title="Quieting the Lizard Brain" href="http://the99percent.com/videos/5822/seth-godin-quieting-the-lizard-brain">video</a> at the end of the <a title="Design Criticism" href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/design-criticism-creative-process/">article for today</a> was really helpful! If you have 20 minutes, it is worth a watch. In it, Seth Godin speaks of the importance of “thrashing” ideas during the beginning stages of a project, so that one can proceed with confidence through the creation and implementation of those projects. In line with that insight, please “thrash” my project tonight!</p>

  <p>With my love of digital archives and my desire to create digital content, digital preservation is an issue near and dear to my heart. On some level, it still seems risky to pour all that time and energy into the creation of digital content that may not be usable in 10 or 20 years. In contrast, information recorded on paper seems much more stable; baring fire, water, and acidic paper, etc., what is written down on paper will remain intact and usable for years to come.</p>

<p>I found the readings for this week, however, encouraging regarding the future of digital data. While there are many questions to be answered and challenged to be tackled, digital preservation seems to be less of an impossible task. What does seem obvious given our previous attempts at preserving this data is that it cannot be preserved in the same way we preserve paper or material artifacts: it cannot be safely stored in an archival box for years until its information is requested. Such an approach has already resulted in carefully stored but inaccessible data because of outdated technology.</p>

<p>I found the piece by Matthew Kirschenbaum et. al., “Digital Forensics and Born-Digital Content in Cultural Heritage Collections,” to offer the most exciting corrective (of the readings) to this approach. Digital Forensics is not something I had thought of in terms of collecting and archiving information, but it makes a lot of sense. In order to access and preserve digital content, we have to work with the information structure of the machines and learn how to uncover the information embedded in digital systems. There is an interesting parallel to be drawn between taking ink samples of Jonathan Edward’s writings to date them and uncovering field updates to see what days a document was opened and worked on. In many ways, the puzzle of digital archival work is what tools are necessary for pulling information from the digital sources, a puzzle that “Digital Forensics” attempts to address.</p>

<p>One question that I had not thought through as much is the question of the usefulness of digital archives because of their abundance of material. Dan Cohen’s article, “The Future of Preserving the Past,” discusses some of the variety of opinions about digital archives and the benefits and problems presented by their openness and the variety of contributions they receive. I agree with the thought that, although carefully selected content is necessary when one must manually search through the material, the large amount of digital content, if properly formatted when submitted (granted a large “if”), can be searched through digitally quite quickly. Sheila Brennen and Mills Kelly’s article on the “Hurricane Digital Memory Bank” also points to challenge of encouraging submissions while ensuring that those submissions are given enough meta-data to make the useful.</p>

<p>All of this points to the fact that storing and investigating digital material is a place of ongoing conversation and innovation. This is an area that is largely unknown, in large part because it is so new – we are just starting to do historical research from solely digital material and we are still unsure about the longevity of the storage solutions we currently have. This uncertainty does increase the risk in creating digital archives, as future preservation is not guaranteed. While I do think there are promising solutions to questions of preservation, it is still the case that digital-born content can very easily be lost or no longer accessible. It is an important consideration for those of us creating digital archives, resources, and the like.</p>

<p>(On a completely tangential note, does our obsession about saving everything strike anyone else as odd? While the large amount of data may be of interest to future historians and I appreciate the concern that the loss of twitter information would mean the loss of a large amount of cultural and social information, I find there to be something odd about our constant eye to future scholarship. Perhaps I am more comfortable with being forgotten by the historical record than I should be. That being said, the loss of all the digital content would be quite problematic, particularly since future thought and discovery builds upon the work of the past.)</p>
