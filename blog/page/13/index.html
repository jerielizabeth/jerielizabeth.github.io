  <p>The readings for this week are very interesting to me, as spatial history and visualizations are two of the areas of scholarship that I am particularly excited about. Many of the reading focused on how visualization and spatial representations map onto humanities scholarship, and whether these are aids to textual arguments or stand on their own as self-contained arguments. I fear that, as long as this remains a question of debate, digital humanities scholars who engage in this sort of work will struggle to achieve academic “recognition” for their work.</p>

<p>I found Alan Liu’s article, <a href="http://digitalhistory.unl.edu//essays/aliuessay.php">“When was Linearity”</a>, very interesting and provocative. I particularly liked his analogy of the uses of Scripture within the Christian tradition, which I thought made a very powerful point about the uses of written works. Linearity is not the only logic at play in the creation of the lectionary – instead, linearity is working with the cycles of the day, the calendar and liturgical year, creating a much more complex interaction with the text and what it seeks to describe. It is significant to note that this lack of linearity does not equate to a lack of logic or intentionality. Instead, the logic is larger than moving from A to B to C and incorporates more than the book alone. (I grew up in a reformed church that does not use a lectionary – the scriptures are chosen based on the minister’s choice or current series topic. These again follow a different logic than linear, a logic that is a bit more difficult to track than that of the lectionary, but a logic none the less.)</p>

<p>I think this is an important point for discussing the values and arguments at play in digital scholarship. I agree with Liu that linearity is not the long-standing universal virtue of intelligent argumentation, but is culturally constructed and dependent upon ideology. I appreciate his claim that we are not dealing with a question of linearity or not, but a question of how to organize the constituent parts of linearity. However, I am not as convinced discussing the changes in terms of different types of linearity is most helpful. Deductive and analytical arguments are what are often being referred to under the name “linear,” where the author moves from a set of givens and deduces the necessary conclusion using the proper logical steps. I would make the claim that arguments can be logical and persuasive without being linear. I am concerned that we are equating linear with logical, and while the later is necessary for scholarly productions – we have to following some form of logic – the former is not. The logic of the spatial representation or visualization may not be linear, but it must be logical (have a guiding and organizational logic) for it to be more than a conglomeration of points.</p>

<p>One thought that came mind both from the <a href="http://www.prototext.org/clio/fall-2010/visualization%20as%20scholarly%20activity.pdf">Jessop article</a>(pdf) and from <a href="http://www.davidmckenzie.info/musings/2011/11/05/visualization-scholarship/">David’s post</a>: I think we may have to think more along the lines of arguments in the sciences and social sciences than philosophical or literary arguments. Story telling on the web will look different than the novel – we in history cannot back ourselves into a corner by insisting on a novelistic style for presenting our arguments. Or at least, it will be very difficult to see visualizations as arguments if we do.</p>

<p>While Jessop is correct, I think, that the uses of technology are different between the humanities and the sciences, the elements that need to be in place for this type of digital scholarship, particularly transparency and documentation of method, have parallels in the scientific or social scientific realm.</p>

<p>Guldi’s essay present another way of thinking about spatial scholarship. She focuses on space as a category of investigation but the investigations she highlights are themselves textual. It is an interesting shift, and one that perhaps allows for a larger picture of the continuities with other forms of scholarship. However, the emphasis on text was disconcerting, and her analysis of spatial awareness in religion is oddly lacking. (At the very least she should have included discussions on how space and liturgy interact and inform each other.) <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/group/spatialhistory/cgi-bin/site/pub.php?id=29">White’s essay</a>, which also argues for space as a category of analysis, provides a more accessible entry point into this larger conversation and one that combines some of the theoretical material on space with projects that seek to explore and understand that space through visualizations.</p>

<p>One final point that I found very interesting and agree with is the need for increased awareness of how to “read” the visualizations, images, and representations created in this sort of scholarship. Noted by both Jessop and in the <a href="http://www.uvasci.org/archive/spatial-technologies-and-methodologies-2009/summary/">Scholarly Communication Institute report</a>, there is a disconnect in our education between our focus on proficiency with written material and the amount of visual material we encounter on a daily basis. I think further education in how to read images and distill the assumptions and arguments contained there in will go a long way toward answer the question of where the argument lies in visualizations and provide the tools for both creating and critiquing these types of arguments.</p>

  <p><a href="http://meganrbrett.net/blog/2011/10/cliof11_week10/">Megan</a> and I are leading discussion this week, so we thought we would blog early to help start conversation about this week’s readings. I have decided to take a survey approach for this week, offering a brief description of what I saw as the major points of the articles and offering some questions for discussion. The topic for this week’s adventures in digital humanities is Data Mining and Distant Reading, two ways of engaging with primary source material that represent both a continuation and a change from the methods of “traditional” scholarship.</p>

<p>First to data mining. All three of our articles focus on the question of data mining, its usefulness, applications and the like. One thing to note is the date of these articles. The first by Dan Cohen and the article by Gregory Crane were written in 2006. The second article by Dan Cohen was written in 2010. The technology for data mining and the sources available for mining have expanded somewhat drastically between 2006 and 2010.</p>

<p>In his first article “<a href="http://chnm.gmu.edu/essays-on-history-new-media/essays/?essayid=40">From Babel to Knowledge: Data Mining Large Digital Collections</a>,” Dan Cohen outlines some early attempt to automate the gathering of historical information. He argues that “… computational methods, which allow us to find patterns, determine relationships, categorize documents, and extract information from massive corpi, will form the basis for new tools for research in the humanities and other disciplines in the coming decade.” The first tool is “Syllabus Finder,” the now discontinued resource for finding syllabi on the web.(1) The logic of the search algorithm is quite interesting. Given that the majority of syllabi contain certain phrases and elements, and that these can be identified through textual analysis, the search algorithm ranks documents it finds by their likeliness of being syllabi, based on the number of standard syllabi features they exhibit. The second is the H-Bot, an experiment in question answering that attempts to answer factual questions about the past. The algorithms run appear to use probability calculus and inductive logic to determine the answer that is most likely to be true, based on the information returned from a wide variety of sources. These sort of searches rely on data mining, on tabulating word use frequencies, and on determining which sorts of word pattern are most likely in which context.</p>

<p>What are your reactions to relying on computer searches, like these, to answer historical questions? Is this computational way of determining answers similar to or different from our own?</p>

<p>Gregory Crane’s article, “<a href="http://www.dlib.org/dlib/march06/crane/03crane.html">What do you do with a million books?</a>” pushes further, asking the reader (and librarians) to move beyond “book” and to start asking what can be accomplished by creating a digital, machine readable, library of written material. He notes that “the ability to decompose information into smaller, reusable chunks, to learn autonomously from a changing environment, and to accept explicit structured feedback from many human users in real time” distinguish digital from print and argues that the information contained in digital libraries can be made more useful and more accessible than its print counterparts. Despite the promises of digital collections, Crane notes some of the challenges in creating such large resources. The set-up costs are high, copyright is a persistent issue, and OCR both creates substantial “noise” and is not always able to handle the variety of page layouts or the distinction between footnotes and text.(2) He concludes with three things necessary for the creation of a successful digital library and its ability to transform humanities scholarship: Enhanced OCR, machine translation, and information extraction.”</p>

<p>This sort of study breaks apart the individual books, making the primary unit of study something different, and something dependent upon the user. What might be the benefits and costs of this way of approaching texts? How comfortable are you with the mode of approaching texts? What happens to authorial authority in this context?</p>

<p>The second article by Dan Cohen, “<a href="http://www.dancohen.org/2010/12/19/initial-thoughts-on-the-google-books-ngram-viewer-and-datasets/">Initial Thoughts on the GoogleBooks Ngram viewer and datasets</a>” provides more current reflexions on where the potential of data mining currently stands. Google Ngrams provides a simple visualization of the frequency of word occurances based upon analysis of the GoogleBooks corpus. As Cohen jokes, it is a digital humanities “gateway drug.” While he acknowledges some of the challenges others have noted about the Google dataset, such as the selection of the corpus, the quality of Google’s OCR and meta-data, and the like, he and others propose that, these downsides being taken into consideration, interesting information can still be gleaned by mining the corpus of Google Books. One important thing that arises from Cohen’s own qualifications of the GoogleBooks data is the need for contextual information, both in terms of how words are studied and mined – not just frequency but word pairings and associations – as well as the need to move from instance to context in order to uncover the significance of the data.</p>

<p>What are your thoughts about what can be learned through Google’s data from digitizing books? Are<a href="http://thebinderblog.com/2010/12/17/googles-word-engine-isnt-ready-for-prime-time/"> the objections raised by Natalie Binder</a> regarding the quality of Google’s OCR and the metadata sufficiently addressed in Dan’s response?</p>

<p>Data-mining can be a form of close reading: a study of a particular word or the study of a particular authors use of language. It can also be a form of distance reading – a way of looking at the larger patterns across texts and across time. Distance reading is covered in detail this week through the work of Franco Moretti.</p>

<p>Graphs, Maps, and Trees: Abstract Models for Literary History is a short and dense book about the these three modes of studying literature, and by extension, other work in the Humanities. The work is an apology for three forms of what he calls “distant reading”, where “distance is … not an obstacle, but a specific form of knowledge: fewer elements, hence a sharper sense of their overall interconnection.”(3) These are graphs (quantitative analysis), maps (spatial analysis), and trees (morphological analysis – form and structure).</p>

<p>In “Graphs,” Moretti takes as his example the history of the novel, building off from the work of others (because working with data is collaborative) to give a quantitative analysis of the history of the novel in Britain, Japan, Italy, Spain, and Nigeria.(4) These studies not only reveal the novel rising in different global regions at different times, but also reveal multiple “rises” of the novel. He then moves to genres in an argument for studying the temporary structures that make up the larger historical patterns. “Epistolary”, “Gothic” and “Historical” novels are dissected further into forty-four sub-genres that appear and disappear in clusters. The question then arises: what brings about this shifts in genre at relatively predictable intervals? Generational differences and political interventions are his answers. One observation he makes that was particularly interesting to me was the recurrence of gender shifts. No one of these was “the rise” of female authors, but instead seems to reflect which genre of literature was preferred at a given time.</p>

<p>“Maps” introduces a second method of examining texts: spatial analysis through the creation of maps and diagrams of how elements relate to one another. He uses as his example “village stories,” arguing that their “circular” arrangement “reverses the direction of history, making … urban readers… look at the world according to the older, ‘centred’ viewpoint of an enclosed village.”(5) As Moretti describes, literary maps “prepare a text for analysis. You chose a unit – walks, lawsuits, luxury goods, whatever – find its occurrences, place them in space… you reduce the text to a few elements, and abstract them from the narrative flow, and construct a new, artificial object… And with a little luck, these maps will be more than the sum of their parts: they will possess ‘emerging’ qualities, which were not visible at the lower level.”(6) The creation of maps or diagrams does not guarantee the emergence of an interesting pattern, but when those patterns do emerge, they can change our understanding of the piece being examined.</p>

<p>Finally, “Trees” turns to the question form, to the tracking of changes or differences in forms brought about by divergence and convergence. In Moretti’s example, he studies those elements of detective novels that made Sir Arthur Conan Doyle successful and his contemporary competition less so – by tracing where other deviate, or where Doyle’s own less successful works deviated, one can arrive at the characteristics of a successful detective story. Moretti describes literary trees as exploring the “microlevel of stylistic mutations,” tracing the divergences and convergences of literary elements.(7)</p>

<p>What are your thoughts as to the connections between these form of analysis (quantitative, spatial, morphological) and the larger questions historians and Moretti himself want to address? Do the detailed and distance views help or enable us to make the claims about patterns or causes that historians wish to make? Of these approaches, “trees” seems to me one of the more challenging for application in history. What sort of questions or areas of inquiry might the creation of trees help historians study?</p>

<p>I am excited to hear your thoughts and opinions on this method of engaging in historical scholarship and textual study.</p>

  <!-- use article.summary(250) if you have Nokogiri available to show just

  <p>This weeks readings focused on the creation and evaluation of digital scholarship. Both the type of work being created and the ways that work is evaluated differ from what has become the standards for academic production and for tenure and promotion.</p>

<p>Looking at the creation of digital scholarship, William Thomas’ “<a title="Writing a digital history article" href="http://digitalhistory.unl.edu//essays/thomasessay.php">Writing a Digital History Article From Scratch</a>” provides in informative reflection on the process of creating something new. Two pieces that I found very interesting and discussion worthy come from Thomas’ use of Mindy McAdams and Stephanie Berger’s work in the <em>Journal of Electronic Publishing</em>. The first is the claim:</p>

<p>“We defend two arguments here,” they began, “1. The writer does not give up control in hypertext. 2. The reader has always had a large degree of control. If the reader’s experience of agency is heightened in hypertext narratives, does it follow that the writer relinquishes authority over the text? That’s the control paradox: We contend that the author gives up very little—perhaps nothing at all.”</p>

<p>This claim hits to the heart of one of the concerns repeatedly expressed about creating digital arguments – the concern that we cannot control the interpretation of non-linear arguments. I have hinted at my concern that control over linear arguments might be something of a false security. Here McAdams and Berger take another approach to the question – while the reader has control, the author still has authority over the text. Just as in print, the author of a website still sets the parameters, still presents the argument, still chooses the evidence and how to link those pieces of evidence. Thinking back to last week and Manovich’s distinction between open and closed interactivity, a digital scholarly article is a great example of a closed interactive piece, and rightly so. The author chooses the information being considered, the hyper-link connections between those pieces of information and the like. I think our concern about being unable to control the audience’s experience with our digital “texts” is a red herring, both in the sense that we both have more control over the digital material than we realize and in the sense that we have less control over the print material than we hope.</p>

<p>The second claims: “McAdams and Berger explained that electronic text and narrative could not be written in the same way as print text and that this difference could not be reverse engineered. In other words we could not write in the standard way for print publication and then cut the text up for digital publication or vice versa. “‘Broken apart’ is perhaps a poor metaphor,” they warned, “it implies a whole that has been damaged. We assert that components ideally are written discretely as components from the very beginning of the process. Extracting components from a pre-existing unilinear text not only proves to be equally (or more) difficult but also appears to produce inferior components.”</p>

<p>Thomas agrees with this opinion and so crafts his digital article in a way that is entirely different than a print article, though using many of the same broad categories of information. Just as in a print article, the site has pieces of evidence, supporting pieces of historiography, and connections between those pieces of information being made by the author. I spent a good amount of time poking around the actual site (<a title="The Difference Slavery Made" href="http://www2.vcdh.virginia.edu/AHR/" target="_blank">The Difference Slavery Made</a>) and it was quite thought provoking in its non-linearity. Each item could be accessed from multiple directions, with each piece of evidence corresponding with pieces of historiography and with its place within the argument of the article. To grasp what Thomas, et al are arguing, the site actually requires a large amount of focused attention, something that is not always the case for the print article. Because of its organization, the site requires the reader to be very active and to navigate through the material intentionally. This is a very interesting and challenging picture of what the digital article could be.</p>

<p><a title="Tenure, promotion and public history" href="http://ncph.org/cms/careers-training/" target="_blank">“Tenure, Promotion, and the Publicly Engaged Academic Historian,”</a> is a study that I found very encouraging when I was applying for programs with the intention of focusing on digital creations. It will be interesting to see how many of the recommendations will be implemented by universities, but it is exciting to see that this conversation is already well under-way before those of us in the class hit the academic job market.</p>

<p>One final thing I wanted to draw attention to from this weeks reading was the difference in the state, or at least the description of the state, of a cyberinfrastructure between “Our Cultural Commonwealth” in 2006 and “<a href="http://www.clir.org/pubs/execsum/sum145.html" target="_blank">Working Together or Apart:Promoting the Next Generation of Digital Scholarship</a>” in 2009. Where “Our Cultural Commonwealth” offers a plea for serious investment in a digital infrastructure, both for the preservation of cultural items and for the expansions of scholarship, “Working Together” speaks of inheriting “a cyberinfrastructure of systems, data, and services” from the sciences and the need for over-all coherence in infrastructure (1, 12). While I understand and appreciate the desire and need to create digital works that can communicate with one another and can be used by others, the effort to create a coherent infrastructure, as we have discussed in other classes, is challenging and costly. To what extent does infrastructure come out of projects and to what extent is infrastructure necessary precondition for projects? And do we need to rely on grants and similar funding models to create infrastructure and projects? As noted in “Our Cultural Commonwealth,” there has been little contribution to infrastructure for work in digital humanities and, given the current political climate, looking for federal support seems to be problematic or at least unreliable. How can we create digital scholarship in ways that are beneficial to the community and that are sustainable?</p>

  <!-- use article.summary(250) if you have Nokogiri available to show just

  <ul>
  <li>What is your inquiry question? What do you want your users to learn?</li>
</ul>

<p>My inquiry questions are “How does space shape religious history and how has religious history shaped space?” and “Can a spatial study of religion point to questions that we have yet thought to ask?” I want my user to come away with a sense of the complexity of the religious landscape, new questions about why certain patterns seem to emerge, and an interest in questions of space as something to be questioned not assumed.</p>

<ul>
  <li>What is your methodological stance?</li>
</ul>

<p>Methodologically, I have chosen to make “place” or location my primary unit of analysis, in order to move away from denominations as the basic unit of religious history, and to point to the importance of location in the development of religious practices and beliefs.</p>

<ul>
  <li>How does your design work to support these goals?</li>
</ul>

<p>Omeka allows for me to create “place” as an item type, thereby making “place” the fundamental building block of my collections and exhibits.</p>

<ul>
  <li>What new things do you need to learn?</li>
</ul>

<p>There are so many new things to learn. I need to learn much about Native American religious practices. I need to learn how to use the Timeline plugin in Omeka. I need to learn how to create my search page. I need to figure out how to define Dublin Core terms… oh dear.</p>

<ul>
  <li>How will you go about learning these things?</li>
</ul>

<p>Collaboration! I will solicit contributions from tribal organizations in Connecticut. I will make friends with people who know more about the technical end of Omeka. And I will do a lot of reading.</p>

<ul>
  <li>What is the rational for the decisions you’re making about source choices (by type, collection, time period, etc.)?</li>
</ul>

<p>This is further defended in my application, but I have chosen Connecticut as a geographic area because of size, and because I know where to look for resources. I have chosen the time period to cover the period of the establishment of the Congregational Church, as well as Native American religious practice prior to colonization. I have chosen not to limit by religious type, because doing so would reinforce longstanding cultural biases and would deprive the resource of its desired complexity. I have chosen to organize by place, rather than by denomination, to draw attention to places where denominational boundaries fail to provide answers. And I have chosen to focus on geolocation to draw attention to space as a mode of historical inquiry.</p>

<ul>
  <li>What questions remain for you to provide a convincing grant application?</li>
</ul>

<p>For the application to be convincing, the narrative needs to draw the reader in and effectively communicate why such a project is useful and why it is important to the reader. I hope that my application communicates my idea well enough and stresses its significance sufficiently to inspire the committee to invest in the project.<br />
And with that, here is my final draft. Thank you everyone for the feedback! It has been very helpful in refining the ideas behind this project.</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/2011/10/17/manovich.html">Hist 696: Manovich</a>, <span>17 Oct 2011</span></h2>
  <!-- use article.summary(250) if you have Nokogiri available to show just

  <p>Oh, for one more week with this text. Well, if I’m dreaming, a month with just this text would be better <img src="http://jeriwieringa.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>

<p>I really enjoyed this text. I have run out of time to write a well-reasoned post, so I will write more after class.</p>

<p>However, one point that Manovich makes repeatedly in the text that I found particularly helpful for our work is the question of interactivity and the question of freedom. Manovich notes, very helpfully, that all cultural products are interactive and that we must remember psychological interactivity as a way that we interact with cultural products. One of the key aspects of engaging with art or cultural products is the associations we draw. I also really appreciated his distinction between open and closed interactivity. Where art allows us to draw whatever associations we may draw (open), there is a real danger in digital work to confuse closed interactivity with open. Merely allowing the user to choose between a number of predetermined options (closed) is not the same as open interactivity. Instead, there is an imposition here of the mind of the creator on the user. The same exists when using the OS or using software to create a 3D object – while the user is free to choose between options, those options are preexisting and imposed. It is important to realize this and to realize that engaging with such objects does limit the ways we can view the world and the things we can create.</p>

<p><strong>[Update] The promised “more” after class is just not going to happen. Sadness.</strong></p>
