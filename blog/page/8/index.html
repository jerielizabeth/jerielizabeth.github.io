  <p><em>Quaker Women: Personal Life, Memory and Radicalism in the Lives of Women Friends, 1780 – 1930</em> is a study of the Priestman and Bright extended families, made possible by the study of the correspondence and religious journals of the women of these interconnected families. The family network of those studied stretched from England to the United States and the record of the family shows how the relationship between religious practice, social norms, and political goals changed over time.</p>

<p>The text focuses primarily on the English portion of the family. It covers the shifting pressures caused by marriage, children, death, and financial concerns and highlights the ways in which religion shaped those responses and was shaped by them.</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/2012/09/06/cosmos-crumbling-by-robert-h-abzug.html"><em>Cosmos Crumbling</em>, by Robert H. Abzug</a> <span>Sep  6</span></h2>
  <!-- use article.summary(250) if you have Nokogiri available to show just
       the first 250 characters -->
  <p>In <em>Cosmos Crumbling: American Reform and the Religious Imagination</em>, Robert Abzug looks at evangelical reform efforts, particularly Temperance, Sabbatarianism, and the incorporation of manual labor into seminary education, as well as “radical” reform causes of abolition, “body reforms” or various health and healing movements, and women’s rights and suffrage. In all of these he focuses on how reform fit into the cosmological beliefs of the reformers, with much of the effort focusing on bringing about the necessary purity to usher in the coming millennium.</p>

<p>Some of the key aspects Abzug identifies of the “cosmos” that shaped much of the reform impulse was the anticipation of the millennium strengthened by the “Great Awakening” of the 18th century, the vision of American liberty/Republicanism as integral to ushering in the millennium, the rise or strengthening of “Manichean” interpretations of world events, and the extension of the Puritan sense of being a chosen people to the new nation as a whole.</p>

<p>Argument: the reformers were motivated and guided by a vision of the young United States as part of the cosmic story of God’s work of redemption, and the eradication of social ills as an integral part of bringing about the end of that grand narrative. Bringing about the millennium involved both the conversion of individuals and the creation of a “godly” society. The vision of the ideal society, however, differed between evangelical reformers and radical reformers, with the former focused primarily on issues of temperance (and its associated ills of abuse and poverty) and Sunday observance while radical reformers challenged some of the basic ideas about race, gender, and religious practice.</p>

<p>One general concern is that the religious cosmos of religious reformers is less developed in Abzug’s analysis than the evangelical reformers, though likely because of the variety of religious beliefs among radical reformers. His main focus here switches to the more political surrounding slavery and women’s rights.</p>

<p>This text reinforced my interest in “ultra-ist” groups, groups that attempted to live according to an all-encompassing understanding of the religious life, groups that removed themselves from the general flow of life and tried to create insular and self-contained societies.</p>

  <p>This semester I am doing an minor field on religion in 19th century America. I am super excited to be focusing on my content area of choice! In addition to the general greatness of religion in the 19th century, the readings I am doing with the amazing <a href="https://twitter.com/sleonchnm">Sharon Leon</a> are focused on religious women. While we will be addressing the major themes of the period, the goal is to intentionally shift the focus to the religious worlds experienced, promoted, and constructed by women.</p>

<p>Our “syllabus” is available at <a href="http://www.6floors.org/teaching/womens-religious-history-19th-century-america-fall-2012/">www.6floors.org/teaching/womens-religious-history-19th-century-america-fall-2012/</a></p>

<p>I will be posting responses to the books on the reading list. If for whatever reason you are interested in following along, my short reactions will be found at <a href="http://jeriwieringa.com/blog/category/relminorfield">jeriwieringa.com/blog/category/relminorfield</a>.</p>

  <p>As part of <a href="http://fredgibbs.net/courses/digital-history-techne/">History 698</a>, currently named “Programming for Historians,” we are creating tutorials for <a href="http://programminghistorian.org/">programminghistorian.org</a>. I will be posting my tutorials here, along with reflections on the process of applying data manipulation to historical investigation.</p>

<p>Expect tutorials on web scrapping and on text mining in the coming months.</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/2012/05/17/rediscovering-the-humanities-in-digital-humanities.html">remembering the humanities in digital humanities</a> <span>May 17</span></h2>
  <!-- use article.summary(250) if you have Nokogiri available to show just

  <p>I was asked a question recently that I wasn’t expecting. I was asked by a ruby developer what could be learned from the past. It was a sincere question. But I realized when he asked it that I generally assume the value of historical inquiry. I assume that you can learn a lot from the past, it just depends on what questions you ask.</p>

<p>But to go further, the question he was asking wasn’t simply, “is there any value in studying history?” It was, what can we, the community of developers and entrapreneurs, learn from the practice of history and from studying our history.</p>

<p>That’s when it struck me – we spend a lot of time in the digital humanities talking about using digital tools and methodologies for studying the past. Which is good. But we don’t spend nearly as much time talking about what the humanities brings to this partnership. Perhaps that is because we assume we know what it is. Or perhaps we are unsure ourselves.</p>

<p>Humanities scholars do bring something, and it’s more than the cultural “raw material” for study. We bring questions, questions about persons and community, questions that help focus attention on structures of power, on the formation of identity, on links between peoples and patterns across events. Questions that highlight contingency and thereby open up opportunities for change.</p>

<p>I find that many people who work in digital production find the concept of the digital humanities intriguing. I also find the question of “so what can you tell us” to be prevalent, a question that, as someone who prefers to study 19th-century religion, I am not sure how to answer.</p>

<p>It would be an interesting experiment to apply the questions and methodologies I want to use for studying the past to study the recent past. It would also be terrifying, because, well, dead people don’t talk back, and that’s comforting. But it would be instructive to see if the story constructed using humanities and digital analysis tracks with and can shed new light on the story this particular community tells itself.</p>

<p>(I just remembered that this is what people who do ethnographic research do all the time. Yay! People who can help!)</p>

<p>I am intrigued by the idea of claiming questions, or a particular mode of inquiry, as the contribution that the humanities brings to this discussion. While the technology is important and digital humanities scholars should not be content with black boxes or giving conceptual direction without getting their hands “dirty” (more on this later), we should not loose site of the humanities in the digital.</p>

<p>So what can a humanities scholar offer a community of developers? Perhaps a story. A story that helps reveal metanarratives – the assumptions about their community and the stories they tell themselves about their place in the world. A story that helps start conversations about where to go next as a community of practice.</p>
