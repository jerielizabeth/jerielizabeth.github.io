  <p><em>The Religious World of Antislavery Women: Spirituality in the Lives of Five Abolitionist Lecturers</em> is a group biography of Sarah and Angelina Gimké, Lucretia Mott, Abby Kelly Foster, and  Sallie Holley. These five women, who actively lectured and agitated for abolition during the mid-1800s, have a complicated religious history that is often presented in overly-simplified fashions by historians interested in questions of the women’s rights and suffrage or abolition. Speicher sets out to retell their history by highlighting how religion played a central role in the careers of each, both in motivating their activities and in shaping their interpretation of the world and their place it in.</p>

<p>Speicher does well handling the spirituality of each of these women on its own terms, describing and honoring the religious struggles they express and the solutions they pursue. Her research and approach reveals that each, though often outside of the bounds of organized religion per se, was deeply shaped by religious seeking and saw her work as an essential part of a religious calling. She interprets their challenges to religious norms as motivated not by a rejection of religion but by a desire for religion to be more.</p>

  <!-- use article.summary(250) if you have Nokogiri available to show just

  <p>This weeks readings focused largely on the religious world of the women who engaged in abolition, temperance, and women’s rights movements during the early part of the nineteenth century.</p>

<p>One point that I am interested in talking about is the overlapping visions of the millennium and of creating a utopian society. The goal of bringing about some perfect end, some culmination of history, is touched upon by all of the authors and in both political and religious terms. Whether that end is the spread of liberty and spread of American Republicanism or the bringing about of a peaceful society where “the lion lays down with the lamb” or the end of sickness through proper diet, there are various ways the desired utopia is imagined and various ways groups attempted to bring that utopia into being. I am interested in the larger context of this utopian impulse – this does not appear to be unique or particularly American but it also feels as though the impulse is particularly strong during this period.</p>

<p>One concern stemming from the work of Abzug is the use of “Manichean” to describe dualistic tendencies in the reformers thought. While it seems fair to say that they saw themselves and the world as part of a cosmic battle between the forces of good and evil, I am concerned that using “Manichean” too widely lessens the strength of critiquing the evangelical reformers particularly on that basis. (also, how many readers know why Manichean patterns are a problem?)</p>

<p>In thinking about trends in the scholarship, I found it interesting that, while Abzug present a helpful broad analysis of the metanarratives / social imaginaries / cosmos behind antebellum reform movements, the writers of the other text are much more narrowly focused on the particular experiences of particular women, rather than on broad patterns of thought. Last semester Mike mentioned that one way of writing history was writing “empathetic” history (and I of course forget the other way). The works by women about women fall pretty squarely into that category, presenting these women as empathetic characters to be understood. While this is very useful, it would be interesting to discuss ways of connecting empathetic accounts to trends in thought and ritual, and the broader implications of those trends.</p>

<p>I do want to do some more reading on the Gimké sisters after the readings for this week, largely for my own benefit as they are incredibly articulate and insightful in their discussions of the role of women in society.</p>

<p>I do appreciate that all the writers, to varying degrees, problematized the framework of domesticity and separate spheres as a way of discussing the role of women in the 19th century. Hardesty relied on these the most, but she also drew attention to the various ways women used these social ideals to claim additional influence, particularly on issues of morality and religion. I am very skeptical about “separate spheres” as a useful mode of analysis (as are many others) so was good to see the analysis in these texts either problematize or ignore this framework.</p>

  <p><em>Quaker Women: Personal Life, Memory and Radicalism in the Lives of Women Friends, 1780 – 1930</em> is a study of the Priestman and Bright extended families, made possible by the study of the correspondence and religious journals of the women of these interconnected families. The family network of those studied stretched from England to the United States and the record of the family shows how the relationship between religious practice, social norms, and political goals changed over time.</p>

<p>The text focuses primarily on the English portion of the family. It covers the shifting pressures caused by marriage, children, death, and financial concerns and highlights the ways in which religion shaped those responses and was shaped by them.</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/2012/09/06/cosmos-crumbling-by-robert-h-abzug.html"><em>Cosmos Crumbling</em>, by Robert H. Abzug</a>, <span> 6 Sep 2012</span></h2>
  <!-- use article.summary(250) if you have Nokogiri available to show just
       the first 250 characters -->
  <p>In <em>Cosmos Crumbling: American Reform and the Religious Imagination</em>, Robert Abzug looks at evangelical reform efforts, particularly Temperance, Sabbatarianism, and the incorporation of manual labor into seminary education, as well as “radical” reform causes of abolition, “body reforms” or various health and healing movements, and women’s rights and suffrage. In all of these he focuses on how reform fit into the cosmological beliefs of the reformers, with much of the effort focusing on bringing about the necessary purity to usher in the coming millennium.</p>

<p>Some of the key aspects Abzug identifies of the “cosmos” that shaped much of the reform impulse was the anticipation of the millennium strengthened by the “Great Awakening” of the 18th century, the vision of American liberty/Republicanism as integral to ushering in the millennium, the rise or strengthening of “Manichean” interpretations of world events, and the extension of the Puritan sense of being a chosen people to the new nation as a whole.</p>

<p>Argument: the reformers were motivated and guided by a vision of the young United States as part of the cosmic story of God’s work of redemption, and the eradication of social ills as an integral part of bringing about the end of that grand narrative. Bringing about the millennium involved both the conversion of individuals and the creation of a “godly” society. The vision of the ideal society, however, differed between evangelical reformers and radical reformers, with the former focused primarily on issues of temperance (and its associated ills of abuse and poverty) and Sunday observance while radical reformers challenged some of the basic ideas about race, gender, and religious practice.</p>

<p>One general concern is that the religious cosmos of religious reformers is less developed in Abzug’s analysis than the evangelical reformers, though likely because of the variety of religious beliefs among radical reformers. His main focus here switches to the more political surrounding slavery and women’s rights.</p>

<p>This text reinforced my interest in “ultra-ist” groups, groups that attempted to live according to an all-encompassing understanding of the religious life, groups that removed themselves from the general flow of life and tried to create insular and self-contained societies.</p>

  <p>This semester I am doing an minor field on religion in 19th century America. I am super excited to be focusing on my content area of choice! In addition to the general greatness of religion in the 19th century, the readings I am doing with the amazing <a href="https://twitter.com/sleonchnm">Sharon Leon</a> are focused on religious women. While we will be addressing the major themes of the period, the goal is to intentionally shift the focus to the religious worlds experienced, promoted, and constructed by women.</p>

<p>Our “syllabus” is available at <a href="http://www.6floors.org/teaching/womens-religious-history-19th-century-america-fall-2012/">www.6floors.org/teaching/womens-religious-history-19th-century-america-fall-2012/</a></p>

<p>I will be posting responses to the books on the reading list. If for whatever reason you are interested in following along, my short reactions will be found at <a href="http://jeriwieringa.com/blog/category/relminorfield">jeriwieringa.com/blog/category/relminorfield</a>.</p>
