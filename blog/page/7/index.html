  <p>so. programming.</p>

<p>right.</p>

<p>who thought this was a good idea?</p>

<p>Oh yeah, me.</p>

<p>This week I have been super focused on catching up.</p>

<p>I thought I was being all brilliant by using data that already existed. Ha! Wrong!</p>

<p>Instead, I spent way too much time getting my head around what data I had, what I wanted to do with it, and what I needed to do to it in order to be able to do said things.</p>

<p>Why was this a problem you ask? Well, there are nearly 200,000 lines in the “text” csv file for one. For two, the names aren’t standardized. For three, the hymnal information I really wanted to use doesn’t have data regarding the texts included nor vice-versa. And I looked, and these text can appear in hundreds (HUNDREDS!) of hymnals. and so my brain exploded.</p>

<p>Then I remembered that we’re supposed to be learning methods, not necessarily solving this particular data problem. So I’ve given up on the hymnals for now and am just looking at texts and authors. I selected out the authors recorded as born between 1800 – 1809 and then pulled the texts that corresponded with them as best I could – this proved somewhat difficult because of the variety of ways the name appeared in the text file.</p>

<p>But the end of the story is I have a database that I can work with, and a join table that seems to be functioning. I have yet to figure out how best to harness the power of the join table, but I think I’m getting somewhere.</p>

<p>The current state of this work is at <a href="http://clio3.jeriwieringa.com/view-author.php">clio3.jeriwieringa.com</a>. (index is viewable at the root)</p>

<p>First caveat: I am not doing any of the dev work here – I am just uploading for presentation. I can’t create a new user on my account (the downside to cheap virtual private servers) so I’m a bit nervous about the whole thing. I want to put this an EC2 instance, but, well, that’s another puzzle to figure out. I am cheating and getting help from my <a href="https://twitter.com/jwieringa">personal tech team</a>, but he’s been a bit busy. So this is my temporary solution.</p>

<p>Second caveat: this is built on top of a “temp” version of the database (and one before I split up the author column in texts to create an accurate join table.) This means if things get changed, it’s ok. for the most part. i guess…</p>

<p>What’s working:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I decided to split the view pages into an author view and a text view. These can be viewed as a large list or paginated.</li>
  <li>Delete does work, but I removed it … didn’t want my database to disappear.</li>
</ul>

<p><span style="font-size: medium;">What still needs work:</span></p>

<ul>
  <li>I am trying to figure out how to create a “show” page, where you would see an individual author information and the list of texts associated with that author. Same (but reversed) with the texts.</li>
  <li>The add and edit page displays for authors, but I’m getting an error during the submit process that I’m still figuring out. This then needs to be done for texts as well. Or I need to figure out how to make my data more simple again.</li>
  <li>And everything else that breaks but I don’t know about yet.</li>
</ul>

<p>And that’s were it’s at right now.</p>

  <p><em>Women Called to Witness: Evangelical Feminism in the Nineteenth Century</em> is a recovery project of the history of women’s involvement and struggle for equality in the evangelical movement. It is an introductory text to the 19th century that focuses particularly on the religious actions of women.</p>

<p>The book focuses largely on women connected in some way to Charles Finney and the reform movements that were connected to his revivals. Hardesty moves quickly through the rise of Finney, the development of various forms of perfectionism, and the prevalence of women in social reform movements. While the book seems on one level to be simply moving thematically through the various venues of female reform activity during the century, the ending chapters reveal that the larger project of the book is presenting a case for the longstanding efforts by evangelical women to expand and transform gender roles and to claim their equality with men.</p>

<p>She is drawing heavily upon and reacting to historiography surrounding the feminization of American Christianity, including Barbara Welter, Nancy Cott, and Ann Douglas.</p>

  <!-- use article.summary(250) if you have Nokogiri available to show just

  <p><em>The Religious World of Antislavery Women: Spirituality in the Lives of Five Abolitionist Lecturers</em> is a group biography of Sarah and Angelina Gimké, Lucretia Mott, Abby Kelly Foster, and  Sallie Holley. These five women, who actively lectured and agitated for abolition during the mid-1800s, have a complicated religious history that is often presented in overly-simplified fashions by historians interested in questions of the women’s rights and suffrage or abolition. Speicher sets out to retell their history by highlighting how religion played a central role in the careers of each, both in motivating their activities and in shaping their interpretation of the world and their place it in.</p>

<p>Speicher does well handling the spirituality of each of these women on its own terms, describing and honoring the religious struggles they express and the solutions they pursue. Her research and approach reveals that each, though often outside of the bounds of organized religion per se, was deeply shaped by religious seeking and saw her work as an essential part of a religious calling. She interprets their challenges to religious norms as motivated not by a rejection of religion but by a desire for religion to be more.</p>

  <p>This weeks readings focused largely on the religious world of the women who engaged in abolition, temperance, and women’s rights movements during the early part of the nineteenth century.</p>

<p>One point that I am interested in talking about is the overlapping visions of the millennium and of creating a utopian society. The goal of bringing about some perfect end, some culmination of history, is touched upon by all of the authors and in both political and religious terms. Whether that end is the spread of liberty and spread of American Republicanism or the bringing about of a peaceful society where “the lion lays down with the lamb” or the end of sickness through proper diet, there are various ways the desired utopia is imagined and various ways groups attempted to bring that utopia into being. I am interested in the larger context of this utopian impulse – this does not appear to be unique or particularly American but it also feels as though the impulse is particularly strong during this period.</p>

<p>One concern stemming from the work of Abzug is the use of “Manichean” to describe dualistic tendencies in the reformers thought. While it seems fair to say that they saw themselves and the world as part of a cosmic battle between the forces of good and evil, I am concerned that using “Manichean” too widely lessens the strength of critiquing the evangelical reformers particularly on that basis. (also, how many readers know why Manichean patterns are a problem?)</p>

<p>In thinking about trends in the scholarship, I found it interesting that, while Abzug present a helpful broad analysis of the metanarratives / social imaginaries / cosmos behind antebellum reform movements, the writers of the other text are much more narrowly focused on the particular experiences of particular women, rather than on broad patterns of thought. Last semester Mike mentioned that one way of writing history was writing “empathetic” history (and I of course forget the other way). The works by women about women fall pretty squarely into that category, presenting these women as empathetic characters to be understood. While this is very useful, it would be interesting to discuss ways of connecting empathetic accounts to trends in thought and ritual, and the broader implications of those trends.</p>

<p>I do want to do some more reading on the Gimké sisters after the readings for this week, largely for my own benefit as they are incredibly articulate and insightful in their discussions of the role of women in society.</p>

<p>I do appreciate that all the writers, to varying degrees, problematized the framework of domesticity and separate spheres as a way of discussing the role of women in the 19th century. Hardesty relied on these the most, but she also drew attention to the various ways women used these social ideals to claim additional influence, particularly on issues of morality and religion. I am very skeptical about “separate spheres” as a useful mode of analysis (as are many others) so was good to see the analysis in these texts either problematize or ignore this framework.</p>

  <p><em>Quaker Women: Personal Life, Memory and Radicalism in the Lives of Women Friends, 1780 – 1930</em> is a study of the Priestman and Bright extended families, made possible by the study of the correspondence and religious journals of the women of these interconnected families. The family network of those studied stretched from England to the United States and the record of the family shows how the relationship between religious practice, social norms, and political goals changed over time.</p>

<p>The text focuses primarily on the English portion of the family. It covers the shifting pressures caused by marriage, children, death, and financial concerns and highlights the ways in which religion shaped those responses and was shaped by them.</p>
