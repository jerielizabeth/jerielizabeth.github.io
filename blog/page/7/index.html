  <!-- use article.summary(250) if you have Nokogiri available to show just

  <p>Durkheim sets out in <em>Elementary Forms </em> to uncover the truth or reality behind “the religious nature of man”(1). (And in this case, man may be appropriately gendered – it is unclear from the selections I read how women are religious if they are identified with the profane.) His method for addressing this question is to begin with the “simplest and most primitive religion” and to uncover from there the universal structures of religious experience(1). He chooses totemism as his primitive religion and works from the particular practices of Australian Aborigines to the idea of <em>Mana</em>, which is the physical force and moral power undergirding totemic life and, he claims, all religions (201). <em>Mana</em> then is explained as society itself — the social experience is the source for the experience of moral power and collective emotion. That experience is then associated with particular items, and those items become “sacred.”</p>

<p>Some points of note:</p>

<ul>
  <li>He distinguishes “magic” from “religion” by claiming that magic is individual and seeking particular advantage in the world where religion is social, the collective representation of collective realities (9).</li>
  <li>He insists on a sharp dualism between the sacred and the profane, claiming that beliefs divide the world into these two categories and that much of religious practice is maintaining that separation. (Interestingly, it is the sacred that is contagious - the concern seems to be that if everything becomes sacred, nothing is sacred … unsure here).</li>
  <li>In the conclusion, religious practices, or the cult, is described as “the sum total of means by which that faith is created and recreated periodically” (420).</li>
  <li>Durkheim is definitely building upon Kant, particular the his ideas surrounding space/time and his emphasis on the role of morality in religion. Durkheim attributes the source of these things in the social.</li>
  <li>I am unsure, but it seems that the roots for the idea of civil religion can be found here.</li>
</ul>

<p>While I am uncomfortable with Durkheim’s approach (any search for essence makes me nervous) and his goal to explain religion and religious experience in natural and horizontal terms, his descriptions about the power of the social and the experience of the social raise some intriguing questions. There is something very powerful about social gatherings for a single purpose, as seen in the heightened religious experience often recorded at extended revivals. Camp meetings and innovations in religious experiences that come out of them could be explored along these lines.</p>

<p>I am also curious as to where Protestant, and particularly Calvinist, religious practice fits into Durkheim’s scheme. It is unclear to me where a religion that insists on the sacredness of all labor and the everyday would fit when sacred and profane are described as opposing and needing to be kept separate.</p>

  <p>In this essay, Smith-Rosenberg investigates the structure of radical religious movements, movements that challenge the prevailing social order. Her primary example is the religious revivals of the 19th century and her main focus is on explaining why these movements seem to be especially appealing to women.</p>

<p>She refers to movements such as these as periods of “religious anti-ritualism,” a concept she develops from the work of Mary Douglas. She notes that periods of anti-ritualism tend to correspond with periods of social change and can be understood as a “social language” to express social experiences (137-9).</p>

<p>To answer the question of why women were particularly attracted to religious anti-ritualism, Smith-Rosenberg draws on the theoretical work of Victor Turner and the structure of “rites of passage” that he identifies. She identifies periods of revival as periods of disorder between systems of order, while acknowledging that these had their own ritualistic form. She describes them as “liminal” periods, as periods where roles and power are renegotiated and when those on the margins of society are able to claim some amount of power. Women, she argues, are always marginal, and so find anti-revivalism more appealing and often remain in the anti-revival mode longer than others.</p>

  <p>Smith-Rosenberg investigates the ways sexuality was constructed in the 19th century and particularly at the relationships between women. She describes a world that is largely homosocial, where the primary relationships for each gender was located among others of the same gender. These relationships were both intimate and socially acceptable, fitting with no apparent contradiction with the societal push for women to assume roles as wives and mothers.</p>

<p>While this description seems connected to the idea of “separate spheres,” the idea that men and women had distinct social sphere raises some interesting questions. For one, it would be interesting to look at conversion patterns in terms of these homosocial networks, rather than families. Also, the discussion of female social worlds needs a corresponding discussion of male social worlds and the prevalence of fraternal societies during this period.</p>

<p>Just as a side note, Smith-Rosenberg seems to describe this sort of social relationship as a world long past. However, it is interesting to note that I have seen similar patterns, though less intense, in conservative evangelical subcultures where interactions across the genders is highly regulated.</p>

  <p>so. programming.</p>

<p>right.</p>

<p>who thought this was a good idea?</p>

<p>Oh yeah, me.</p>

<p>This week I have been super focused on catching up.</p>

<p>I thought I was being all brilliant by using data that already existed. Ha! Wrong!</p>

<p>Instead, I spent way too much time getting my head around what data I had, what I wanted to do with it, and what I needed to do to it in order to be able to do said things.</p>

<p>Why was this a problem you ask? Well, there are nearly 200,000 lines in the “text” csv file for one. For two, the names aren’t standardized. For three, the hymnal information I really wanted to use doesn’t have data regarding the texts included nor vice-versa. And I looked, and these text can appear in hundreds (HUNDREDS!) of hymnals. and so my brain exploded.</p>

<p>Then I remembered that we’re supposed to be learning methods, not necessarily solving this particular data problem. So I’ve given up on the hymnals for now and am just looking at texts and authors. I selected out the authors recorded as born between 1800 – 1809 and then pulled the texts that corresponded with them as best I could – this proved somewhat difficult because of the variety of ways the name appeared in the text file.</p>

<p>But the end of the story is I have a database that I can work with, and a join table that seems to be functioning. I have yet to figure out how best to harness the power of the join table, but I think I’m getting somewhere.</p>

<p>The current state of this work is at <a href="http://clio3.jeriwieringa.com/view-author.php">clio3.jeriwieringa.com</a>. (index is viewable at the root)</p>

<p>First caveat: I am not doing any of the dev work here – I am just uploading for presentation. I can’t create a new user on my account (the downside to cheap virtual private servers) so I’m a bit nervous about the whole thing. I want to put this an EC2 instance, but, well, that’s another puzzle to figure out. I am cheating and getting help from my <a href="https://twitter.com/jwieringa">personal tech team</a>, but he’s been a bit busy. So this is my temporary solution.</p>

<p>Second caveat: this is built on top of a “temp” version of the database (and one before I split up the author column in texts to create an accurate join table.) This means if things get changed, it’s ok. for the most part. i guess…</p>

<p>What’s working:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I decided to split the view pages into an author view and a text view. These can be viewed as a large list or paginated.</li>
  <li>Delete does work, but I removed it … didn’t want my database to disappear.</li>
</ul>

<p><span style="font-size: medium;">What still needs work:</span></p>

<ul>
  <li>I am trying to figure out how to create a “show” page, where you would see an individual author information and the list of texts associated with that author. Same (but reversed) with the texts.</li>
  <li>The add and edit page displays for authors, but I’m getting an error during the submit process that I’m still figuring out. This then needs to be done for texts as well. Or I need to figure out how to make my data more simple again.</li>
  <li>And everything else that breaks but I don’t know about yet.</li>
</ul>

<p>And that’s were it’s at right now.</p>

  <!-- use article.summary(250) if you have Nokogiri available to show just

  <p><em>Women Called to Witness: Evangelical Feminism in the Nineteenth Century</em> is a recovery project of the history of women’s involvement and struggle for equality in the evangelical movement. It is an introductory text to the 19th century that focuses particularly on the religious actions of women.</p>

<p>The book focuses largely on women connected in some way to Charles Finney and the reform movements that were connected to his revivals. Hardesty moves quickly through the rise of Finney, the development of various forms of perfectionism, and the prevalence of women in social reform movements. While the book seems on one level to be simply moving thematically through the various venues of female reform activity during the century, the ending chapters reveal that the larger project of the book is presenting a case for the longstanding efforts by evangelical women to expand and transform gender roles and to claim their equality with men.</p>

<p>She is drawing heavily upon and reacting to historiography surrounding the feminization of American Christianity, including Barbara Welter, Nancy Cott, and Ann Douglas.</p>
