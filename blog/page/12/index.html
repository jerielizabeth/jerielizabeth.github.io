  <p>I am a strong supporter of the idea that ideas and knowledge cannot be owned and that both are most productive when opened up to others.</p>

<p>I am also a strong supporter of the idea that cultural products should be available to be remixed, reworked, and recreated.</p>

<p>I probably have a lower view of copyright than I should, having never produced anything that I felt I was due monetary remuneration for.</p>

<p>But, still.</p>

<p>I understand the value and necessity of copyright, ensuring that those who engage in creative pursuits are not left in the poor house, like so many of their artistic forebears.</p>

<p>But can we have some balance?</p>

<p>Questions of open access to knowledge are incredibly pertinent for all of our scholarly work, whether digital or not. Whether or not, and how, we can include images in our monographs is an issue determined by copyright and publishing restrictions. Who can read the work we publish in academic journals in order to qualify for tenure is determined by the open access policy, or not, of the journal we publish in? Is open access is important enough to risk ones academic career on it? Will we make publication choices based on who retains copyright and whether the work is made freely available?</p>

<p>The questions only increase in the digital realm. But many of the questions can be answered by actions taken. If scholars choose to think about copyright and access, if they choose to publish using a copyright such as creative commons that allows for sharing, some change can happen. However, as <em>Free Culture</em> and the current debates over <a href="http://americancensorship.org/">SOPA</a> reveal, this is a contested area in many arenas, not just within academia, and these are questions with large political and structural ramification.</p>

<p>The texts for this week did a great job of describing some of the questions and challenges being debated both inside academia with questions of publishing and open access (fyi: <digitalhumanitiesnow.org> is no longer passively edited) and outside with larger questions of copyright and the structures underlying digital technology. Another text (and there are many in this general vein) that argues for keeping the internet open is Jonathan Zittrain&#8217;s [*The Future of the Internet and how to stop it*][2]. According to Zittrain, we should be a little more worried about the shift to mobile as the primary means of accessing the web.* Another interesting text is *From CounterCulture to Cyberculture* by Fred Turner. In the book, Turner traces the roots of what he calls &#8220;digital utopianism&#8221; to the counterculture movements of the 1960s. In some ways, it was a disconcerting text, in that I didn&#8217;t realize that I was a hippie. However, the text offers an alternative and not always sympathetic perspective on the open access, open software movements. That being said, I am very happy to be a hippie and to advocate for the potential of the internet.</digitalhumanitiesnow.org></p>

<p>As Megan already noted, these questions are not abstract academic questions. The current congress is again hearing arguments over a bill to increase regulation of the internet, this time in line with recommendations made by major media companies who are seeking to put an end to piracy of copyrighted material. Creative Commons is taking a stand against it, as is Google and others. And because of the stakes involved, this is a fight that will continue until either profit models change to better fit the digital structure or the digital structure is changed to information and content easier to control.</p>

<p>*Geek fail – there is a distinction between web and internet and I forget how it goes. Please forgive. and advise.</p>

  <!-- use article.summary(250) if you have Nokogiri available to show just

  <p>This weeks readings were largely straightforward, but interesting in the variety of strong opinions on that this topic often generates. From Wikipedia to Mechanical Turk to Flickr Commons, the major sites of crowd engagement and activity are covered in our readings, though the crowd-sourced elements of our own <a href="http://wardepartmentpapers.org/">Papers of the War Department</a> and transcription tool <a href="http://scripto.org/">Scripto</a> were conspicuously missing.</p>

<p><a href="http://chnm.gmu.edu/essays-on-history-new-media/essays/?essayid=42">Rosenzweig</a>‘s article on Wikipedia touches on many of the general points of contention over the value of the information on Wikipedia and the role of academic-types in the creation of wikipedia articles. The complaint and corresponding discussion of Wikipedia’s emphasis away from original research and toward the more bland encyclopedia entries confused me to some extent. Wikipedia is not set up as a publishing platform for historians’ latest investigations and explanations of historical events. Instead, it is a quick entry point into a subject matter. As Rosenzweig notes “Teachers have little more to fear from students’ <em>starting</em> with <em>Wikipedia</em> than from their starting with most other basic reference sources. They have a lot to fear if students *stop *there.” It would also be interesting to look at the concerns expressed in 2006 in relation to Wikipedia’s current state in 2011.</p>

<p>Mechanical Turk, covered in the <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14.06/crowds.html?pg=3&amp;amp;topic=crowds&amp;amp;topic_set=">Wired Article</a>, is more troubling to me. While I agree that there are many inefficiencies in business that crowd-sourcing can help mediate, the huge disparities between what people will accept as pay for one-time work and full time employment are troubling. However, the idea of opening up Research and Development questions to a wider audience of enthusiasts is interesting and has proved very productive. But again there is an unfortunate separation between the problem-solvers and those that benefit from the solutions.</p>

<p>The write up on the <a href="http://6floors.org/teaching/HIST_696_F11/files/Kalfatovic%2Bet%2Bal%2BFlickr%2BPaper%2BAuthor%2BProofs.pdf">Smithsonian</a> decision to post pictures on Flickr Commons points both to the inefficiencies in convincing large institutions to share openly online (it took a long time for them to consider sharing) and the benefits of doing so. The comment that sharing through Flickr did not drive traffic back to the Smithsonian site was interesting, revealing a split between how organizations expect people to use the information and content online and the ways they actually interact with it.</p>

<p>Trusting the “general public” to create valuable content can be difficult, as seen in many of these debates and discussions. Groups can be both more intelligent than we allow, and more foolish than we hope. Creating ways for engagement that both bring the public in and allow them to surprise you, while still creating safeguards to ensure quality are two necessary ingredients for making crowd-sourcing productive.</p>

<p>Another approach not commented upon in these reading is the use of games to both encourage and control crowd-sourced contributions to larger projects. The Library of Finland has used games in a particularly successful way. (Read the write up <a href="http://library.gameology.org/2011/02/13/ocr-correct-good-crowdsourcing/">here</a> or play the game <a href="http://www.digitalkoot.fi/en/splash">here</a>) By playing the game, you correct the OCR of the nation’s newspapers. I find this to be a particularly promising mode of crowd-sourcing as both parties are providing a service – the game makes the work fun for users and provides a distraction while the players help make their national archive better – and it is geared toward the creation of a public good, not an individual company’s benefit. There is a lot of potential in crowd-sourcing, but also a number of ways it can be abused or used poorly, making it, like anything, a tool to be used with care and consideration.</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/2011/11/06/visual-arguments-and-non-linear-logic.html">Hist 696: Visual arguments and non-linear logic.</a>, <span> 6 Nov 2011</span></h2>
  <!-- use article.summary(250) if you have Nokogiri available to show just

  <p>The readings for this week are very interesting to me, as spatial history and visualizations are two of the areas of scholarship that I am particularly excited about. Many of the reading focused on how visualization and spatial representations map onto humanities scholarship, and whether these are aids to textual arguments or stand on their own as self-contained arguments. I fear that, as long as this remains a question of debate, digital humanities scholars who engage in this sort of work will struggle to achieve academic “recognition” for their work.</p>

<p>I found Alan Liu’s article, <a href="http://digitalhistory.unl.edu//essays/aliuessay.php">“When was Linearity”</a>, very interesting and provocative. I particularly liked his analogy of the uses of Scripture within the Christian tradition, which I thought made a very powerful point about the uses of written works. Linearity is not the only logic at play in the creation of the lectionary – instead, linearity is working with the cycles of the day, the calendar and liturgical year, creating a much more complex interaction with the text and what it seeks to describe. It is significant to note that this lack of linearity does not equate to a lack of logic or intentionality. Instead, the logic is larger than moving from A to B to C and incorporates more than the book alone. (I grew up in a reformed church that does not use a lectionary – the scriptures are chosen based on the minister’s choice or current series topic. These again follow a different logic than linear, a logic that is a bit more difficult to track than that of the lectionary, but a logic none the less.)</p>

<p>I think this is an important point for discussing the values and arguments at play in digital scholarship. I agree with Liu that linearity is not the long-standing universal virtue of intelligent argumentation, but is culturally constructed and dependent upon ideology. I appreciate his claim that we are not dealing with a question of linearity or not, but a question of how to organize the constituent parts of linearity. However, I am not as convinced discussing the changes in terms of different types of linearity is most helpful. Deductive and analytical arguments are what are often being referred to under the name “linear,” where the author moves from a set of givens and deduces the necessary conclusion using the proper logical steps. I would make the claim that arguments can be logical and persuasive without being linear. I am concerned that we are equating linear with logical, and while the later is necessary for scholarly productions – we have to following some form of logic – the former is not. The logic of the spatial representation or visualization may not be linear, but it must be logical (have a guiding and organizational logic) for it to be more than a conglomeration of points.</p>

<p>One thought that came mind both from the <a href="http://www.prototext.org/clio/fall-2010/visualization%20as%20scholarly%20activity.pdf">Jessop article</a>(pdf) and from <a href="http://www.davidmckenzie.info/musings/2011/11/05/visualization-scholarship/">David’s post</a>: I think we may have to think more along the lines of arguments in the sciences and social sciences than philosophical or literary arguments. Story telling on the web will look different than the novel – we in history cannot back ourselves into a corner by insisting on a novelistic style for presenting our arguments. Or at least, it will be very difficult to see visualizations as arguments if we do.</p>

<p>While Jessop is correct, I think, that the uses of technology are different between the humanities and the sciences, the elements that need to be in place for this type of digital scholarship, particularly transparency and documentation of method, have parallels in the scientific or social scientific realm.</p>

<p>Guldi’s essay present another way of thinking about spatial scholarship. She focuses on space as a category of investigation but the investigations she highlights are themselves textual. It is an interesting shift, and one that perhaps allows for a larger picture of the continuities with other forms of scholarship. However, the emphasis on text was disconcerting, and her analysis of spatial awareness in religion is oddly lacking. (At the very least she should have included discussions on how space and liturgy interact and inform each other.) <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/group/spatialhistory/cgi-bin/site/pub.php?id=29">White’s essay</a>, which also argues for space as a category of analysis, provides a more accessible entry point into this larger conversation and one that combines some of the theoretical material on space with projects that seek to explore and understand that space through visualizations.</p>

<p>One final point that I found very interesting and agree with is the need for increased awareness of how to “read” the visualizations, images, and representations created in this sort of scholarship. Noted by both Jessop and in the <a href="http://www.uvasci.org/archive/spatial-technologies-and-methodologies-2009/summary/">Scholarly Communication Institute report</a>, there is a disconnect in our education between our focus on proficiency with written material and the amount of visual material we encounter on a daily basis. I think further education in how to read images and distill the assumptions and arguments contained there in will go a long way toward answer the question of where the argument lies in visualizations and provide the tools for both creating and critiquing these types of arguments.</p>

  <p><a href="http://meganrbrett.net/blog/2011/10/cliof11_week10/">Megan</a> and I are leading discussion this week, so we thought we would blog early to help start conversation about this week’s readings. I have decided to take a survey approach for this week, offering a brief description of what I saw as the major points of the articles and offering some questions for discussion. The topic for this week’s adventures in digital humanities is Data Mining and Distant Reading, two ways of engaging with primary source material that represent both a continuation and a change from the methods of “traditional” scholarship.</p>

<p>First to data mining. All three of our articles focus on the question of data mining, its usefulness, applications and the like. One thing to note is the date of these articles. The first by Dan Cohen and the article by Gregory Crane were written in 2006. The second article by Dan Cohen was written in 2010. The technology for data mining and the sources available for mining have expanded somewhat drastically between 2006 and 2010.</p>

<p>In his first article “<a href="http://chnm.gmu.edu/essays-on-history-new-media/essays/?essayid=40">From Babel to Knowledge: Data Mining Large Digital Collections</a>,” Dan Cohen outlines some early attempt to automate the gathering of historical information. He argues that “… computational methods, which allow us to find patterns, determine relationships, categorize documents, and extract information from massive corpi, will form the basis for new tools for research in the humanities and other disciplines in the coming decade.” The first tool is “Syllabus Finder,” the now discontinued resource for finding syllabi on the web.(1) The logic of the search algorithm is quite interesting. Given that the majority of syllabi contain certain phrases and elements, and that these can be identified through textual analysis, the search algorithm ranks documents it finds by their likeliness of being syllabi, based on the number of standard syllabi features they exhibit. The second is the H-Bot, an experiment in question answering that attempts to answer factual questions about the past. The algorithms run appear to use probability calculus and inductive logic to determine the answer that is most likely to be true, based on the information returned from a wide variety of sources. These sort of searches rely on data mining, on tabulating word use frequencies, and on determining which sorts of word pattern are most likely in which context.</p>

<p>What are your reactions to relying on computer searches, like these, to answer historical questions? Is this computational way of determining answers similar to or different from our own?</p>

<p>Gregory Crane’s article, “<a href="http://www.dlib.org/dlib/march06/crane/03crane.html">What do you do with a million books?</a>” pushes further, asking the reader (and librarians) to move beyond “book” and to start asking what can be accomplished by creating a digital, machine readable, library of written material. He notes that “the ability to decompose information into smaller, reusable chunks, to learn autonomously from a changing environment, and to accept explicit structured feedback from many human users in real time” distinguish digital from print and argues that the information contained in digital libraries can be made more useful and more accessible than its print counterparts. Despite the promises of digital collections, Crane notes some of the challenges in creating such large resources. The set-up costs are high, copyright is a persistent issue, and OCR both creates substantial “noise” and is not always able to handle the variety of page layouts or the distinction between footnotes and text.(2) He concludes with three things necessary for the creation of a successful digital library and its ability to transform humanities scholarship: Enhanced OCR, machine translation, and information extraction.”</p>

<p>This sort of study breaks apart the individual books, making the primary unit of study something different, and something dependent upon the user. What might be the benefits and costs of this way of approaching texts? How comfortable are you with the mode of approaching texts? What happens to authorial authority in this context?</p>

<p>The second article by Dan Cohen, “<a href="http://www.dancohen.org/2010/12/19/initial-thoughts-on-the-google-books-ngram-viewer-and-datasets/">Initial Thoughts on the GoogleBooks Ngram viewer and datasets</a>” provides more current reflexions on where the potential of data mining currently stands. Google Ngrams provides a simple visualization of the frequency of word occurances based upon analysis of the GoogleBooks corpus. As Cohen jokes, it is a digital humanities “gateway drug.” While he acknowledges some of the challenges others have noted about the Google dataset, such as the selection of the corpus, the quality of Google’s OCR and meta-data, and the like, he and others propose that, these downsides being taken into consideration, interesting information can still be gleaned by mining the corpus of Google Books. One important thing that arises from Cohen’s own qualifications of the GoogleBooks data is the need for contextual information, both in terms of how words are studied and mined – not just frequency but word pairings and associations – as well as the need to move from instance to context in order to uncover the significance of the data.</p>

<p>What are your thoughts about what can be learned through Google’s data from digitizing books? Are<a href="http://thebinderblog.com/2010/12/17/googles-word-engine-isnt-ready-for-prime-time/"> the objections raised by Natalie Binder</a> regarding the quality of Google’s OCR and the metadata sufficiently addressed in Dan’s response?</p>

<p>Data-mining can be a form of close reading: a study of a particular word or the study of a particular authors use of language. It can also be a form of distance reading – a way of looking at the larger patterns across texts and across time. Distance reading is covered in detail this week through the work of Franco Moretti.</p>

<p>Graphs, Maps, and Trees: Abstract Models for Literary History is a short and dense book about the these three modes of studying literature, and by extension, other work in the Humanities. The work is an apology for three forms of what he calls “distant reading”, where “distance is … not an obstacle, but a specific form of knowledge: fewer elements, hence a sharper sense of their overall interconnection.”(3) These are graphs (quantitative analysis), maps (spatial analysis), and trees (morphological analysis – form and structure).</p>

<p>In “Graphs,” Moretti takes as his example the history of the novel, building off from the work of others (because working with data is collaborative) to give a quantitative analysis of the history of the novel in Britain, Japan, Italy, Spain, and Nigeria.(4) These studies not only reveal the novel rising in different global regions at different times, but also reveal multiple “rises” of the novel. He then moves to genres in an argument for studying the temporary structures that make up the larger historical patterns. “Epistolary”, “Gothic” and “Historical” novels are dissected further into forty-four sub-genres that appear and disappear in clusters. The question then arises: what brings about this shifts in genre at relatively predictable intervals? Generational differences and political interventions are his answers. One observation he makes that was particularly interesting to me was the recurrence of gender shifts. No one of these was “the rise” of female authors, but instead seems to reflect which genre of literature was preferred at a given time.</p>

<p>“Maps” introduces a second method of examining texts: spatial analysis through the creation of maps and diagrams of how elements relate to one another. He uses as his example “village stories,” arguing that their “circular” arrangement “reverses the direction of history, making … urban readers… look at the world according to the older, ‘centred’ viewpoint of an enclosed village.”(5) As Moretti describes, literary maps “prepare a text for analysis. You chose a unit – walks, lawsuits, luxury goods, whatever – find its occurrences, place them in space… you reduce the text to a few elements, and abstract them from the narrative flow, and construct a new, artificial object… And with a little luck, these maps will be more than the sum of their parts: they will possess ‘emerging’ qualities, which were not visible at the lower level.”(6) The creation of maps or diagrams does not guarantee the emergence of an interesting pattern, but when those patterns do emerge, they can change our understanding of the piece being examined.</p>

<p>Finally, “Trees” turns to the question form, to the tracking of changes or differences in forms brought about by divergence and convergence. In Moretti’s example, he studies those elements of detective novels that made Sir Arthur Conan Doyle successful and his contemporary competition less so – by tracing where other deviate, or where Doyle’s own less successful works deviated, one can arrive at the characteristics of a successful detective story. Moretti describes literary trees as exploring the “microlevel of stylistic mutations,” tracing the divergences and convergences of literary elements.(7)</p>

<p>What are your thoughts as to the connections between these form of analysis (quantitative, spatial, morphological) and the larger questions historians and Moretti himself want to address? Do the detailed and distance views help or enable us to make the claims about patterns or causes that historians wish to make? Of these approaches, “trees” seems to me one of the more challenging for application in history. What sort of questions or areas of inquiry might the creation of trees help historians study?</p>

<p>I am excited to hear your thoughts and opinions on this method of engaging in historical scholarship and textual study.</p>
