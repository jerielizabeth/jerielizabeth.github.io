  <p>The readings for this week focused largely on questions of design and the process of web development. The nuts and bolts of what we are attempting to do, with guidelines to help us avoid some of the more egregiousness website design errors. I found that most of the information reinforced what I have heard before or what I have found most helpful when dealing with websites. However, it was very helpful to be exposed to a vocabulary for describing those elements to others.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/">http://www.alistapart.com/</a>. In addition to having very useful and informative essays, the layers of humor and snarky-ness were quite delightful. I found these much more helpful, even when they were beyond my skill, than the resources in <em>Digital History. *This may be because *Digital History</em> assumes very little awareness of or engagement with technical resources, while alistapart.com is writing to an audience of practitioners. Also, alistapart.com has the benefit of having continually updated content, while *Digital History, *because it is a published monograph presented on the web, is beginning to show its age.</p>

<p>The information regarding metedata was, to be honest, overwhelming. The graphic from <a title="Seeing Standards" href="http://www.dlib.indiana.edu/~jenlrile/metadatamap/">Seeing Standards</a>, while adding to the feeling of drowning in possibilities for categorization, makes me wonder if there is something broken here. While metadata is important and useful, it seems that there are a lot of different opinions about how it is important and useful. Given the number of public history professionals in the room, I am excited to hear what those who use metadata more regularly have to say.</p>

<p>I am afraid that much of my thinking this week was from a tangent inspired by the site. In the essay on <a title="web typology" href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/on-web-typography/">web typology</a>,  Jason Santa Maria supports his claim that Trajan is the movie font by pointing to a vimeo clip that argues the same. Kirby Ferguson, who made the film, has also made a series about the subject of “remix”, beginning with the argument that all that Hollywood produces is a remix to a larger claim that all human discovery is based on “remixing”. (You can find the first of these videos <a title="here" href="http://www.vimeo.com/14912890">here</a>.) This seems to dovetail nicely with the emphasis within the opensource community on sharing and recreating, with the “hacker” impulse to pull together from everywhere and recreate,  and, as further proof that historians are really a small step away in practice from the digital world,  with the recombining of sources and interpretations that is played out in footnotes in historical writing. If one accepts that his or her historical practice is less about the creation of original interpretations and more about the productive (and maybe new) combination of previous ideas and creations, then it is much easier to engage in collaboration and, I would suggest, more creative works. The idea of the solitary genius is already belied, particularly in history, by the mountain of footnotes and cross-references. One of my motivating concerns is that of closed information and the notion of “owning ideas.” The culture surrounding the internet is one that often challenges the premise that ideas can be owned, and I am very interested in seeing what sparks fly as this culture interacts with the academic culture, currently predicated on rewarding individuals for their ideas. I do hope the free exchange of ideas is left standing when the dust settles.</p>

<p>How to connect that tangent back to the idea of web-design and metadata… good web design enables that exchange of ideas. Conforming to web standards, design principles, and metadata structures allows for the digital medium to aid, rather than detract from, the information and enables engagement with the user. As argued by the authors, good web design fades into the background, and is “the creation of digital environments that facilitate and encourage human activity; reflect or adapt to individual voices and content; and change gracefully over time while always retaining their identity.”(1) The goal is not the creation of flashy sites (no, really, please, no flash), but the creation of sites that promote interaction with information and user agency.</p>

  <p>(How meta)</p>

<p>For those of you following along at home, this weeks readings consisted of:</p>

<p>Dan Cohen and Roy Rosenzweig’s <a href="http://chnm.gmu.edu/digitalhistory/"><em>Digital History: A Guide to Gathering, Preserving, and Presenting the Past on the Web</em></a>,</p>

<p>Susan Hockey’s entry “History” from Blackwell’s <a href="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/companion/view?docId=blackwell/9781405103213/9781405103213.xml&amp;amp;doc.view=print&amp;amp;chunk.id=ss1-2-1&amp;amp;toc.depth=1&amp;amp;toc.id=0"><em>A Companion to Digital Humanities</em></a>,</p>

<p>Robert B. Townsend’s article, <a href="http://www.historians.org/perspectives/issues/2010/1011/1011pro2.cfm">“How is New Media Reshaping the Work of Historians”</a>,</p>

<p>and from the Journal of American History, an exchange between Dan Cohen, Michael Frisch, Patrick Gallagher, Steve Mintz, Kirsten Sword, Amy Murrell Taylor, William Thomas, and William Turkel entitled <a href="http://www.journalofamericanhistory.org/issues/952/interchange/index.html">“The Promise of Digital History”</a>.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>While there are many points and themes that can be highlighted from these pieces, those which I was most struck by revolved around the disagreements in goal of digital humanities in general and digital history in particular. These are conflicts that I have already seen in action in my short time in the digital humanities world and are conflicts that I think can be very productive.</p>

<p>Susan Hockey makes the observation in her “History” that a “Hypertext in particular attracted a good many theorists. This helped to broaden the range of interest in, and discussion about, humanities computing but it also perhaps contributed to misapprehensions about what is actually involved in building and using such a resource. Problems with the two cultures emerged again, with one that was actually doing it and another that preferred talking about doing it.” While I chuckled at the criticism of the theorists in this description, this is a definite divide within the digital humanities field. My own intuitions coincide with those of the “builders,” which was one of my motivating reasons for locating myself in a history department, rather than American Studies. However, it is important to note that there is a choice to be made here, and work being done on both sides of that divide. Do we as humanists engage in exploring and explicating the assumptions and structures that underlie our digital experiences? Do we explore the layers of mediation (and there are many) between the user and the digital artifact or tool? Do we use the digital tools and see what can be created with them to expand knowledge and access to knowledge? These questions are interesting and productive, but do represent different schools of thought regarding how humanists approach the digital, and I am sure there are additional schools of which I am unaware. It is interesting that, despite the label “Digital Humanities”, there is a lot of differing opinions about what this sort of work entails.</p>

<p>(Side note: this split also exists in Public Humanities. I took a class during my MA in Public Humanities and I quickly realized that there are a variety of understandings of “public”, public engagement, and the like.)</p>

<p>A second point of conflict, more appropriate to digital history, is the question of what digital technology means for scholarship and how we craft and present historical arguments. Robert Townsend’s assessment of the survey given to historians on their use of digital technology offers an interesting view into two of the different approaches. Figure 6, which displays why historians consider publishing online, points to a pattern which I found interesting. While both avoiders and power-users saw reaching wider audiences, both popular and academic, and publishing more quickly as reasons to consider online publishing, avoiders rarely saw “telling the narrative in a new or different way” as a possible benefit, and  apparently none thought it would “improve presentation.” While these were lower also for the power users, I would suggest that this drop-off suggests a difference in perception of the requirements for history scholarship. If one assumes the traditional narrative and linear argument to be the best way to communicate scholarly research in history, then the benefits of digital technologies are limited. The monograph or scholarly article is well suited to the linear argument and narrative. There are minor gains to be had by producing a monograph in a digital form, but it is unclear if it is worth the effort. I think the lack of interest in “improved presentation” and new ways of telling the narrative is due to these historians being very committed to the argument structure of the monograph.</p>

<p>However, it is the possibilities for scholarship beyond the linear monograph that, I think, make up the “promise of digital history.” And, fortunately for me, those authors largely seem to agree. Taylor notes that digital history requires a shift in understanding the role of the historian. He notes, “…I think the difficulties students have also stem in part from the fact that we are asking them to make a huge conceptual shift in how they think about history. The traditional chronological or thematic narratives of history are so deeply entrenched in their minds—and, frankly, in most of our minds—that it is very difficult to start thinking of creating history that is not so linear and is “participatory” or “interactive” (or akin to “gaming”—an analogy I like). A student who is friendly to digital technology can be quite uncomfortable with thinking about history in new ways. This discomfort may also have to do with being asked to rethink the position of the historian—in ceding some control to the user to define the experience, what control does the historian/creator retain?” Digital history offers the possibility of thinking about and inviting others to engage with history in new ways. This opens up questions of what constitutes a historical argument? and how can we convey information differently? Megan also takes up this theme in her <a href="http://mebrett.wordpress.com/2011/09/11/cliof11-week3/">post</a>, discussing the benefits of engaging through exploration and discovery, in contrast to more linear presentations.</p>

<p>These articles reveal different aspects of digital history, but one common theme is that digital history cannot simply be traditional history made digital. Archives and papers and maps are all helpful and are all part of digital history, but they are only the beginning. The questions I am excited about are what digital history means for how we think about history, how we engage with history and how we draw connections about the past.</p>

  <!-- use article.summary(250) if you have Nokogiri available to show just

  <p>This semester I decided to put my career plan of digital history into action, taking on a semester project to digitize a decade of the Banner. The project was to both give me experience in the process of digitization, the different tools, methodologies and practices that exist, and to do some research into my own denomination.</p>

<p>This really was a terrible idea.</p>

<p>I mean, it isn’t really terrible. I am learning a lot and slowly am making progress.</p>

<p>The good news is I am learning about a lot of open-source, creative solutions to digitization. Because Yale, for all its money and prestige, is probably the least friendly place to be taking on this project. Just a reminder that prestige does not equate to best resources, particularly if one is trying to do something “new.”</p>

<p>Sorry, venting. Anyway, I will digitize these Banners, if it kills me.</p>

<p>Current attempt: build your own scanner with a digital camera and process the images with Linux-based software. It may not be “professional,” but it will be functional.</p>

<p>Images to follow. If this works, I will post on how you too can digitize on a minimal budget!</p>

<p>And now for something a little different. I decided there were too many words in this blog, so we’ll try a video. This is a clip from <em>Cold Mountain</em> that showcases Sacred Harp hymn singing.</p>

<p>Sacred Harp is something I knew nothing about until January, when I signed up for a class taught by the Yale music department. It is a unique form of hymn singing that still thrives in the South and has developed a “diaspora” following across the United States. It is the oddest thing in the world to listen to at first, but it grows on you. The history of this style of singing is something I am still trying to piece together, but it began in New England as an effort to improve the psalm singing in the churches and quickly moved south, and has become identified as a distinctly southern style of singing. All I can say is it’s a lot of fun to sing, especially as there is no real emphasis on performance, just on gathering to sing together.</p>

<p>Oh, and I sing the part that Jude Law sings. Mostly because the melody is in the tenor, many of the melodies are familiar, and I can’t figure out how to read the shapes in order to sing the other parts. But women tenors are in high demand. And so it works <img src="http://jeriwieringa.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":-D" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>
