  <p>Accessibility and visual arguments. While there was some debate as to whether the Tufte piece was indeed on the list for today, I found the combination of Tufte with the accessibility pieces to be productive. Much of the reading on accessibility dealt with the needs of visually impaired, blind, or mobility impaired users. These users require the information on websites to be organized logically and  well annotated. And the tips for creating websites that are sensitive to the needs of these users were very helpful and seem relatively easy, if perhaps time consuming, to implement.</p>

<p>There is a high emphasis on text and textual information in the accessibility pieces. And yet, there are other users who will understand visual arguments more easily than textual arguments. Tufte’s instructions on well-crafted visual argumentation provided helpful guidelines for creating visual pieces that argue well for a particular position or interpretation. But, then, how does the creator also provide access to that visual argument for users who cannot see it?</p>

<p>I really enjoyed the Tufte text, particularly chapters 4-7. But then, I am fond of anyone who quotes Salmon Rushdie. As someone with minimal artistic training, I know well the impulse to over label. The reminder to simplify and to focus on clarity of presentation was a good one. I was particularly interested in Tufte’s endorsement of confections and juxtaposition. I was not expecting this form of visual argument to be promoted. Perhaps because my impression of confections is that they are old and complex, a collection of symbols that can be more than challenging to interpret. The confection is an argument by association and layering and a simplification of the confection is a powerful form of visual argument. His example of El Lissitzky’s self portrait is one such simplification, layering symbols but each symbol remains distinct, thus retaining it’s individual symbolic function.</p>

<p>Images like Lissitzky’s cannot be communicated easily or well in words, making it accessible to someone who is blind or has impaired vision would be challenging. It is an interesting challenge to balance the visual nature of the web and the need to be aware of the broader audience.</p>

<p>The readings for the week reminded me of the need to be aware of and sensitive to the needs of users who have various disabilities. Making websites that are more easily read by screen readers and other adaptive technologies is labor intensive, but seems to me that it also results in more semantically rich html. But not all visual arguments can be effectively annotated. It may be the case that some arguments will need to be made twice – once visually and once textually – offering parallel arguments to increase the accessibility of the information.</p>

<p><strong>Tools:</strong></p>

<p>Since Megan already mentioned the Chrome development tool, I should tip my hat to firebug for firefox. It is very handy, though I am afraid my browser is becoming a bit bloated with addons.</p>

<p>For those who are interested in other tools for hand-coding website, I am using a trial version of <a title="Link to Coda by Panic, web development software" href="http://www.panic.com/coda/">Coda by Panic</a> and really like it. It is a text editor, CSS editor, file-transfer tool, generates previews, and a number of other things that I haven’t even tapped yet. It is well priced, given everything it offers, but isn’t cheap, which is its main drawback.</p>

<p>One more, but I am still figuring this out. I have been attempting to use <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a> for some of my development, as it provides an easy way to create backups and provides version control.</p>

  <p>Wow.</p>

<p>Well, that took awhile. But my image assignment is <a href="http://www.jeriwieringa.com/portfolio/image.html" target="_blank">up</a> and feedback is welcome and appreciated as always! The trouble with these images is that it takes so long (or is impossible, really) to fix anything without starting over. Ah well! Can just attempt to make it better the next time.</p>

<p>There is not much to say that I didn’t include the narrative on my page. So please refer there for a brief description of where and how I altered the images.</p>

<p>And so I fear it will be a short blog post this week.</p>

<p>My conclusions from the image assignment: Photoshop is not as bad as I thought. But it is not an easy tool to work with and one can spend all of ones time in the program attempting to make things “just right”. However, that is a critique more of the user than the tool and I am glad to have gained an ability to manipulate images so that they better communicate the desired information.</p>

  <p>*Please pardon my dust. I was experimenting with themes and homepages and general web presence but have yet to make this one beautiful. *</p>

<p>I really enjoyed the readings for today. The extended piece by Morris was very interesting, both because Morris is a good story teller and because it required me to think about expectations surrounding images in general and photographs in particular. Personally, I find myself generally confused by the debates about truth and authenticity that surrounded the FSA photographs. Photographs conceal as much as they reveal – they record a moment in time but do not record the context. They are as true as they are untrue. And they are the product of an intentional creator – even if the content is unmoved, the frame is chosen and some things are intentionally excluded. They are not neutral – they are created intentionally and need to be used critically.</p>

<p>But I wonder if these questions about truth and authenticity need to be contextualized. Why was it so important during the 1930s and 40s for images to be “true”? Why do my own intuitions align more with those of Bill Ganzel, who dismisses much of the controversy surrounding the photographs because they are “true” to the larger reality, regardless if the particulars of the situation were altered? Have expectations about images changed? Or are similar expectations and ideas expressed when dealing with digitally enhanced images? (In other words, why do <a href="http://jezebel.com/5865114/hm-puts-real-model-heads-on-fake-bodies">H&amp;M’s digital models</a> cause a stir?)</p>

<p>My intuition is that questions about truth and authenticity are both unanswerable and unhelpful, but that discussing expectations about images and focusing on reading images critically provide a way to deal with some of the questions that the FSA images raise. The images were created within a particular context, a particular thought-space about what images do. And I think investigating that thought-space is helpful in interpreting the images themselves, both as shaping and being shaped by the larger culture.</p>

<p>But I think I am not the only one to respond that, yes, images must be dealt with critically, just like text. <a href="http://meganrbrett.net/blog/2012/03/h697-images-and-other-non-textual-sources/">Megan</a> and <a href="http://gwcohrs.wordpress.com/2012/03/04/truthiness/">Geoff</a> have already written eloquently of the need to treat all of ones evidence critically.</p>

<p>In other news, I spent some time this week experimenting with the tools described in Lynda and, while I have nothing that is ready to be seen, I am happy to report that there is a general easing of tension between Photoshop and myself. The program is incredibly powerful and after it dealt beautifully with some ink spots, I have become less antagonistic toward its complexity and adobe-ness. Which is good, because I am going to have to spend a lot of time with it in the next two weeks…</p>

  <p>Oh Photoshop.</p>

<p>This section of the course will be my Achilles heel. I have opened Photoshop in the past and the result has been anxiety. There are so many ways to do so many different things – and I have very little understanding of what algorithms Photoshop is deploying. It is both exciting and disconcerting to push a button and have the software “optimize” an image for me.</p>

<p>The Lynda tutorials raised a number of questions for me. I am interested in using Photoshop for wire-framing designs and for the creation of graphics and the manipulation of images for the web. However, I was confused by the creation of buttons and animated gifs. It seems that much of this can be created using CSS3, although browser compatibility makes this a less reliable route to take. But the tutorial, while helpful, made an odd set of assumptions about knowledge of Photoshop. While the setting up the workspace was very helpful, I ran into trouble with using the particular tools – it would be helpful to go through the tools and to explain what each of them do. But perhaps I just need to spend time this week clicking on every button… yikes.</p>

<p>The color resources that were part of the assignment for today were helpful! To this point, I have been attempting to generate color schemes from my mind… an effort that has been only moderately successful. But the types of drawing from the colors within an image or using kuler to draw from already generated color schemes was very helpful. Also, the NonDesigners Photoshop book was helpful, or at least will be helpful when I’m working on the image project, and it will be fun to apply the tools to the images at hand.</p>

<p>Thinking more abstractly for a moment, <a href="http://shuerta1.wordpress.com/2012/02/25/the-digital-filter-application-process/">Sheri</a> and <a href="http://www.davidmckenzie.info/musings/2012/02/25/playing-with-photoshop/">David </a>made some thought provoking comments on their blogs about the ability to manipulate images, which Photoshop enables, and some of the ethical concerns that historians do, or should, consider. This appears to be the “hot topic” of the week and I wanted to add a small contribution. Perhaps it is helpful to think in terms of primary and secondary sources. In adjusting the images, adding color, fixing blemishes, we are creating a secondary source, a source that is an interpretation of the primary material. This seems particularly true in the case of adding colors or restoring missing sections of photographs. However, the creation of these secondary materials does not detract from or replace the primary material. In my mind, digitization should always supports, never replaces the physical object. When does this way, the original photograph remains the same and good scholarship requires returning to the primary material. Just as we already know not to rely on secondary material for quotes and we know to return to the primary material, historical research done with digital tools also must be aware of these limitations in secondary sources. (<a href="http://gwcohrs.wordpress.com/2012/02/26/fear-and-loathing/">Geoff makes a similar point in his post</a> – I agree, though it is interesting to consider how digital archives, though secondary, can be used as primary text, similar to scholarly edited editions.)</p>

<p>I did not make any changes to my type assignment yet! I will work on that again soon.</p>

<p>*While I have not directly commented, I am responding to Sheri, David, and Geoff in this post (see links above).</p>

  <p>I am unsure what to blog about this week. But I thought maybe I would go through my choices for the<a href="http://jeriwieringa.com/portfolio/type.html"> type assignment </a>and give a sense of where I am thinking of taking the design.</p>

<p>My goal for the overall design was to promote readability and to provide a clean, but pleasant framing for the material. The left sidebar contains some of the metadata for the site. My thought here was to make citation as easy as possible, and so both publishing information and the copyright restrictions that Richard set up are visible. I also added some anchor tags to allow for some navigation in the text – this will be easier and more obvious with some of the other texts I am dealing with. Another thought for future iterations is linking to either pdf or epub versions of the text so that the pieces can be downloaded easily.</p>

<p>The background for the site is an image I made (or attempted to make) in Photoshop. I wanted to experiment with a fixed background, so that the page had the effect of only the text moving. The text comes from the Book of Common Prayer, but the ratio between the image and the content is too large to make any sense of the words. I had hoped to make the background faded, but I think I will need to wait until I have a better handle of Photoshop to accomplish that.</p>

<p>The color choice is a desperate attempt to move away from what I have discovered is my obsession with sage. The “dusty rose” effect on the activated links works but is not my favorite. But I do like the background being an off-white. I think it makes the text gentler on the eyes for reading.</p>

<p>I used a variety of fonts for the project. I am using Typekit for the header – the font is Great Primer. The other fonts I downloaded from <a href="http://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/">The League of Moveable Type</a>. I used Fanwood Text for the main text and Sorts Mills Goudy for the titles and everything else. I am happy with Fanwood for the major text sections; it has pleasant spacing and line height.</p>

<p>Overall I am happy with how this has turned out, but of course, I have stared at it so long that I’ve become attached! Any suggestions are welcome!</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I commented on <a href="http://www.historiclove.com/wordpress/2012/02/19/hist-697-font-face/">Claire’s</a> and <a href="http://objectfiles.wordpress.com/2012/02/19/type-assignment-trial-and-error/">Beth’s post</a> this week.</p>
