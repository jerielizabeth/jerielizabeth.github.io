  <p>*Please pardon my dust. I was experimenting with themes and homepages and general web presence but have yet to make this one beautiful. *</p>

<p>I really enjoyed the readings for today. The extended piece by Morris was very interesting, both because Morris is a good story teller and because it required me to think about expectations surrounding images in general and photographs in particular. Personally, I find myself generally confused by the debates about truth and authenticity that surrounded the FSA photographs. Photographs conceal as much as they reveal – they record a moment in time but do not record the context. They are as true as they are untrue. And they are the product of an intentional creator – even if the content is unmoved, the frame is chosen and some things are intentionally excluded. They are not neutral – they are created intentionally and need to be used critically.</p>

<p>But I wonder if these questions about truth and authenticity need to be contextualized. Why was it so important during the 1930s and 40s for images to be “true”? Why do my own intuitions align more with those of Bill Ganzel, who dismisses much of the controversy surrounding the photographs because they are “true” to the larger reality, regardless if the particulars of the situation were altered? Have expectations about images changed? Or are similar expectations and ideas expressed when dealing with digitally enhanced images? (In other words, why do <a href="http://jezebel.com/5865114/hm-puts-real-model-heads-on-fake-bodies">H&amp;M’s digital models</a> cause a stir?)</p>

<p>My intuition is that questions about truth and authenticity are both unanswerable and unhelpful, but that discussing expectations about images and focusing on reading images critically provide a way to deal with some of the questions that the FSA images raise. The images were created within a particular context, a particular thought-space about what images do. And I think investigating that thought-space is helpful in interpreting the images themselves, both as shaping and being shaped by the larger culture.</p>

<p>But I think I am not the only one to respond that, yes, images must be dealt with critically, just like text. <a href="http://meganrbrett.net/blog/2012/03/h697-images-and-other-non-textual-sources/">Megan</a> and <a href="http://gwcohrs.wordpress.com/2012/03/04/truthiness/">Geoff</a> have already written eloquently of the need to treat all of ones evidence critically.</p>

<p>In other news, I spent some time this week experimenting with the tools described in Lynda and, while I have nothing that is ready to be seen, I am happy to report that there is a general easing of tension between Photoshop and myself. The program is incredibly powerful and after it dealt beautifully with some ink spots, I have become less antagonistic toward its complexity and adobe-ness. Which is good, because I am going to have to spend a lot of time with it in the next two weeks…</p>

  <p>Oh Photoshop.</p>

<p>This section of the course will be my Achilles heel. I have opened Photoshop in the past and the result has been anxiety. There are so many ways to do so many different things – and I have very little understanding of what algorithms Photoshop is deploying. It is both exciting and disconcerting to push a button and have the software “optimize” an image for me.</p>

<p>The Lynda tutorials raised a number of questions for me. I am interested in using Photoshop for wire-framing designs and for the creation of graphics and the manipulation of images for the web. However, I was confused by the creation of buttons and animated gifs. It seems that much of this can be created using CSS3, although browser compatibility makes this a less reliable route to take. But the tutorial, while helpful, made an odd set of assumptions about knowledge of Photoshop. While the setting up the workspace was very helpful, I ran into trouble with using the particular tools – it would be helpful to go through the tools and to explain what each of them do. But perhaps I just need to spend time this week clicking on every button… yikes.</p>

<p>The color resources that were part of the assignment for today were helpful! To this point, I have been attempting to generate color schemes from my mind… an effort that has been only moderately successful. But the types of drawing from the colors within an image or using kuler to draw from already generated color schemes was very helpful. Also, the NonDesigners Photoshop book was helpful, or at least will be helpful when I’m working on the image project, and it will be fun to apply the tools to the images at hand.</p>

<p>Thinking more abstractly for a moment, <a href="http://shuerta1.wordpress.com/2012/02/25/the-digital-filter-application-process/">Sheri</a> and <a href="http://www.davidmckenzie.info/musings/2012/02/25/playing-with-photoshop/">David </a>made some thought provoking comments on their blogs about the ability to manipulate images, which Photoshop enables, and some of the ethical concerns that historians do, or should, consider. This appears to be the “hot topic” of the week and I wanted to add a small contribution. Perhaps it is helpful to think in terms of primary and secondary sources. In adjusting the images, adding color, fixing blemishes, we are creating a secondary source, a source that is an interpretation of the primary material. This seems particularly true in the case of adding colors or restoring missing sections of photographs. However, the creation of these secondary materials does not detract from or replace the primary material. In my mind, digitization should always supports, never replaces the physical object. When does this way, the original photograph remains the same and good scholarship requires returning to the primary material. Just as we already know not to rely on secondary material for quotes and we know to return to the primary material, historical research done with digital tools also must be aware of these limitations in secondary sources. (<a href="http://gwcohrs.wordpress.com/2012/02/26/fear-and-loathing/">Geoff makes a similar point in his post</a> – I agree, though it is interesting to consider how digital archives, though secondary, can be used as primary text, similar to scholarly edited editions.)</p>

<p>I did not make any changes to my type assignment yet! I will work on that again soon.</p>

  <p>I am unsure what to blog about this week. But I thought maybe I would go through my choices for the<a href="http://jeriwieringa.com/portfolio/type.html"> type assignment </a>and give a sense of where I am thinking of taking the design.</p>

<p>My goal for the overall design was to promote readability and to provide a clean, but pleasant framing for the material. The left sidebar contains some of the metadata for the site. My thought here was to make citation as easy as possible, and so both publishing information and the copyright restrictions that Richard set up are visible. I also added some anchor tags to allow for some navigation in the text – this will be easier and more obvious with some of the other texts I am dealing with. Another thought for future iterations is linking to either pdf or epub versions of the text so that the pieces can be downloaded easily.</p>

<p>The background for the site is an image I made (or attempted to make) in Photoshop. I wanted to experiment with a fixed background, so that the page had the effect of only the text moving. The text comes from the Book of Common Prayer, but the ratio between the image and the content is too large to make any sense of the words. I had hoped to make the background faded, but I think I will need to wait until I have a better handle of Photoshop to accomplish that.</p>

<p>The color choice is a desperate attempt to move away from what I have discovered is my obsession with sage. The “dusty rose” effect on the activated links works but is not my favorite. But I do like the background being an off-white. I think it makes the text gentler on the eyes for reading.</p>

<p>I used a variety of fonts for the project. I am using Typekit for the header – the font is Great Primer. The other fonts I downloaded from <a href="http://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/">The League of Moveable Type</a>. I used Fanwood Text for the main text and Sorts Mills Goudy for the titles and everything else. I am happy with Fanwood for the major text sections; it has pleasant spacing and line height.</p>

<p>Overall I am happy with how this has turned out, but of course, I have stared at it so long that I’ve become attached! Any suggestions are welcome!</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I commented on <a href="http://www.historiclove.com/wordpress/2012/02/19/hist-697-font-face/">Claire’s</a> and <a href="http://objectfiles.wordpress.com/2012/02/19/type-assignment-trial-and-error/">Beth’s post</a> this week.</p>

  <p>This week was more of a “big picture” week for me, thus the half step towards the type assignment. I focused most of my “Clio” brain power this week on website organization, on tracking down possible comparison sites for my project, on thinking about layout, and on searching for fonts. Project Canterbury is a very text heavy site and as such my choices in fonts will be particularly noticeable. This also makes my choice a bit complicated, as the font has to both go with the material, which is largely 19th-century documents, and has to be readable on-screen. Thanks to<a href="http://meganrbrett.net/blog/2012/02/h697-seeking-out-new-worlds/"> Megan’s suggestion</a>, I am  looking at fonts from the <a href="http://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/">League of Moveable Type</a>, particularly <a href="http://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/fanwood">Fanwood </a>for more focused reading sections, and <a href="http://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/sorts-mill-goudy">Sorts Mill Goudy</a>. These fonts seem to strike a good balance between referencing the older type of the primary material and being readable on the screen. Now to find a good decorative font to accompany them.</p>

<p>In terms of sites that take on similar projects, I spent some time this week looking at the Willa Cather archive and the Walt Whitman archive. Both of these sites deal with a large amount of text and I found them helpful for organizing my thoughts about what my site needs to accomplish. While both sites have their weaknesses, particularly in terms of design, their approach to organizing the data was particularly helpful.</p>

<p>The resources for this week were helpful in pointing to ways CSS3 gives additional control over the appearance of the site and for pointing to resources for finding and properly calling on fonts. There seem to be a number of resources for creating a well-formatted @font-family stack. It is just a little unfortunate that the lack of standardization results in such a variety of file formats and no guarantee that what we want will appear on the screen of our users. Ah well. Graceful degradation, I believe, is the term for what we want to insure, so at least the site is useable even if IE is determined to have its own way.</p>

<p>On to putting these fonts to work!</p>

<p>Addendum: I posted on <a href="http://celestetuongvy.wordpress.com/2012/02/12/round-2-type-fonts-and-styling">Celeste</a>‘s blog post this week.</p>

  <p>To be honest, typography scares me. I mean, it looks great and I understand why it is important and that you can do many things with typography to make your text interesting. But books on typography seem to enjoy highlighting the numerous ways people use typography poorly or focus on overused and reviled typefaces but rarely explain why (but I like Papyrus…). It is enough to cause me much anxiety. I don’t know enough to avoid the mistakes and end up feeling that it is all rather arbitrary.</p>

<p>Left brain.</p>

<p>However I will attempt to understand this strange new world and will attempt to experiment with type in my next assignments. Just please don’t laugh too loudly at my gaffs.</p>

<p>I do know that the project I will be working on will require a more traditional typography, something that invokes religious copy from the 18th and 19th centuries. I would also, however, like add some tension and flair by adding some more modern layout elements, something to avoid being overly cliche and to add some visual interest to the site.</p>

<p>Another helpful resource for design, particularly if anyone else is painfully analytical and lacking in design sense, is <em>Design for Hackers</em> by David Kadavy. It explains <strong>why</strong> Comic Sans is a problematic font and assumes that design is not your first language. Very helpful for the anxious analytic brain.</p>

<p>Also, the final section in <em>Thinking with Type</em> discussed grids but was very vague about the application of grids to the web. I am interested in experimenting with a grid system for web-design. I have looked at <a href="http://blueprintcss.org/">blueprint</a> and the <a href="http://960.gs/">960 grid system</a> and am leaning toward the 960 grid system. Is anyone interested in experimenting with me?</p>
