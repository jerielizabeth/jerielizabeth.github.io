  <p>This week I have focused on learning some of the tricks and tips for scraping websites, in preparation for presenting tonight. For the most part, this has gone really well. The existing tutorials on the programming historian for using <a href="http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/automated-downloading-with-wget">wget</a> and <a href="http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/working-with-files-and-web-pages">python</a> are very intuitive and easy to follow and most of my presentation will be on these.</p>

<p>Wget is a very useful tool when dealing with a well organized website and I think will be most useful right of the bat for most of us. It’s quick and easy and run through the command line.</p>

<p>Using Python is a bit more complicated but does allow for more detailed scraping. While I won’t be focusing on this, you can use Python to not only pull down whole copies of sites but also to filter those sites for particular information before you save it to your own machine (or wherever you’re saving it).</p>

<p>One problem I am still struggling with is how to cycle through a list of URL using Python. While writing the script to save one file is straightforward enough, I spent much of yesterday looking for any indication of how to save multiple files. I kinda have a loop going on, but can’t figure out if it is parsing my csv file of links correctly. And I can’t figure out how to change the file name each time, so even when I get something out, it is rewriting itself in a single file. If I can’t figure this out today (and I’m coming for help with this, Fred), I think I can present a work-around using cURL.</p>

<p>Also, it is unclear to me how to build in a wait time when using Python or cURL. Seems that this would be useful in order to be a good internet citizen.</p>

<p>Two discoveries as a result of this. 1. Hymnary.org puts a cap on the calls to the api from a given ip address. <img src="http://jeriwieringa.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> oops. and 2. There is a ton more information in the json document that I am looking to call down than I had realized. I think I will be able to do more this semester than I originally thought my data allowed. yippie!!</p>

  <!-- use article.summary(250) if you have Nokogiri available to show just

  <p>The readings this week are a somewhat eclectic collection of readings relating to religion and women in the west. Since I am keeping the more detailed notes in handwritten form this week, the texts were: Sarah Deutsch, <em>No Separate Refuge</em>; Devon Mihesuah, <em>Cultivating the Rosebuds</em>; Ramón Gutiérrez, <em>When Jesus Came, the Corn Mothers Went Away</em>; and Peggy Pascoe, <em>Relations of Rescue</em>.</p>

<p>One of the recurring features of these works is the tendency to use yet again the rhetoric of “separate spheres” and the “cult” of “womanhood.” In these text, references were usually deployed to complicate the ideas of separate spheres but of often relied on ideas of domesticity and the cult of womanhood. It is not hard to see why: from the rhetoric of Pascoe’s late 19th century female reformers to the ideas about race and gender taught and emulated by Cherokee students, it does seem that ideals about gender and domesticity formed a large part of the framework that shaped many women’s experience during the 19th century. Given the readings from last week, however, it is interesting to me how resilient the language of separate spheres is. Even when mentioned to show how it fails, the theme of spheres seems embedded in the historians subconscious in ways that are perhaps veering toward being more revealing of the present than of the past. Perhaps …</p>

<p>The two pieces that were most obviously dissertations, <em>Cultivating the Rosebuds</em> and <em>No Separate Refuge </em>were interesting to read as examples of types of studies that can be done as dissertation projects. Mihesuah’s piece was encouraging in its narrow focus, although many of the theoretical questions regarding the construction of race and gender were left underdeveloped. Deutsch’s piece, on the other hand, presented an intimidating picture of the dissertation project, as her area of study and her questions were much wider in scope and broader in implication. On the other hand, her study, which focuses on Chicano, and particularly Chicana, strategies for maintaining cultural integrity in the face of Anglo-American culture, offers a more nuanced and positive depiction of the role of women in Hispanic American culture than had previously existed. Her’s is instructive of how preconceived ideas about cultural structures can obstruct the view of different strategies for exercising authority, something that I will also need to keep in mind while studying women in religious movements.</p>

<p>Also, as a side note, Deutsch’s piece offers some interesting possibilities for geo-spatial analysis, as she is describing community networks that span great distances and are changing over time.</p>

<p>Pascoe’s piece also touches on the dangers inherent in assuming a singular vision of “female culture.” While her work is motivated by current concerns about the programs of cultural feminists, she grounds her concerns by examining the similar reform efforts of Protestant women during the late 19th century. The women she studies open houses of refuge with the goal of female uplift and challenging patriarchy, however, they do so by assuming the centrality of “purity and piety” to all women. The result is a complicated story that throws the relationship between gender, race, and class into sharp relief.</p>

<p>Gutiérrez’s piece was one that I was excited to read but a bit disappointed with for my current purposes. The central part of his investigation focuses on the 17th and 18th centuries, with minimal gesturing toward the 19th. His centering of Pueblo and Acoma origin myths provides an interesting contrast to approaches such as Daniel Richter’s <em>Facing East from Indian Country</em> and offers a useful picture of native cosmology prior to Spanish conquest. However, much of his analysis is focused on drawing a stark distinction between the centrality of sexuality to Pueblo culture and the sexual repression he identifies as guiding Spanish Catholicism. The sections of the book that focus on his central question of how marriage structured social inequality focuses largely on Spanish and Spanish colonials marriages.</p>

<p>In all, these books offer pictures of the complicated processes by which gender is described and prescribed.</p>

  <p>Today I learned the difference between “update” and “insert” and what happens when you update your join table instead of inserting a new entry.</p>

<p>I almost have CRUD – keep finding new things to add/tweak. Also my files are growing increasingly complex to keep track of all of the different ways data is being passed.</p>

<p>Questions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>difference between “object orientated” and “procedural” in the mysqli manual</li>
  <li>when to use “if” for calling a command and when it isn’t necessary – is this just to test that it’s working (so you can have an ‘else’)?</li>
  <li>Can we talk about refactoring?</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>

<p>UPDATE: I have CRUD. (Delete is hidden). available at <a href="http://clio3.jeriwieringa.com/view.php">clio3.jeriwieringa.com/view.php</a></p>


  <h2><a href="/blog/2012/09/27/victor-turner-betwixt-and-between-the-liminal-period.html">Victor Turner, “Betwixt and Between: The Liminal Period&#8221;</a> <span>Sep 27</span></h2>
  <!-- use article.summary(250) if you have Nokogiri available to show just
       the first 250 characters -->
  <p>In the manner of sociologists and anthropologists, Victor Turner is investigating structures of human behavior by analyzing the practices and rituals of “simpler” societies.  In “Betwixt and Between,” he is investigating rites of passage, the cultural practices surrounding the movement from one state (any type of stable or recurrent condition that is culturally recognized (94)) to another. This transition includes separation, margin, and aggregation. Most of his attention is focused on the marginal, or liminal, period where, he notes, many standard social markers, including sex distinctions, do not apply (97). In addition, during the liminal period for the culture he studies, the neophyte is taught what Turner refers to as the <em>sacra</em>, the cosmology and mythical history of the people (103). This teaching of the <em>sacra </em>involves 1) the reduction of culture into recognized components, often through exaggeration of the integral aspects of culture or the body, 2) the recombination of those components in monstrous patterns or shapes, which further draws attention to the various components now removed from their usual context, and 3) the recombination of components in ways that fit the new state and status of the neophyte (106).</p>

<p>In Turner’s description, the liminal person is in transition from one culturally recognized state to another, and this transitional period helps to prepare them for assuming the responsibilities of the upcoming state. It is striking that this very particular account of transition rituals has been expanded so broadly in cultural theory and has been extended to include persons are perpetually “liminal” — always in transition between two states but never able to enter the next or return to the previous.</p>
