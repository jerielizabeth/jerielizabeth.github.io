  <p>Terryl L. Givens, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">People of Paradox: A History of Mormon Culture</span></p>

<ul>
  <li>Givens approaches the study of Mormon culture by focusing first on what he describes as five major tensions within Mormon thoughts (authority vs. individualism, searching vs. certitude, disintegration of sacred distance, exile vs. integration, American vs. universal) and then looking at how those tensions play out in the cultural arenas of intellectual thought, architectures, music, theater, literature, and visual (fine) art. He identifies 1890 (the official end of polygamy) as a division point between two phases of cultural development and both insists on and argues for Mormonism as a particularly American religion.</li>
</ul>

<p>Lawrence Foster, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Women, Family and Utopia: Communal Experiments of the Shakers, the Oneida Community, and the Mormons</span>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Foster is expanding his earlier work on religion and sexuality. He argues for studying groups who offer a more radical reaction to social reorganization by claiming that their responses reveal the general tensions and issues, that they are carrying the logic of the possible solutions to their conclusions and so, with careful reading, allow us to see those more general patterns. He focuses on questions of how these groups understood themselves, looking less to explain them or determine their success than to draw attention to how they constructed their world and what problems that construction sought to address. His conclusion offers an excellent summary of his major points for each group.</li>
</ul>

<p>—————-</p>

<p>This weeks readings were both interesting and a little disappointing. We knew going in that there needed to be some reading against the text — secondary literature on women in Mormonism is relatively non-existent and that which is focuses largely on the polygamy issue.</p>

<p>After reading the introduction to Givens’ book, the general scarcity of women in his analysis makes sense – it is a structural consequence of his definitional choices. His analysis focuses on the more systematic and often more male-driven aspects of culture — the thought systems, the creation of fine art, etc — areas where there is female influence, but that is generally speaking dominantly male. As a result, areas of popular culture, like crafts and vernacular arts, household decorations, art that offers a glimpse of one aspect of women’s culture, is left outside of the analysis. Also, his choice to focus primarily on art created for religious purposes makes it more difficult for him to find the types of creative tensions he is looking for.</p>

<p>In addition, it is not clear to me that the tensions and paradoxes described by Givens’ are particular to the Latter-Day Saints. While they are resolved in particular and often inventive ways, the five tensions he describes can just as easily describe many if not every other branch of Christian thought and practice.</p>

<p>Foster’s approach in his analysis is closer to what I hope to do in mine, in that he attempts to understand these movement on their own terms. He, however, is focused on the social aspects of the imagination at play in these communities much more than the religious aspects, although these are very mutually informing. Style and repetition concerns aside, it is a very useful book for starting to look at these communities in terms of their own internal logic and goals.</p>

<p>One major weakness in both of these works is the general silence on questions of race and class. This is particularly noticeable in Foster, in that a discussion of the construction of gender without these problematic. Givens looks less at gender, but his ability to deal with questions of race and class is also hampered by his choice to identify culture in ways that make those questions less apparent.</p>

<p>Coming out of these readings, there are a couple of themes that I am seeing repeated across the works that might provide interesting starting points for my own analysis. First, is the anxiety over interpretation and salvation that seems to be growing with the emphasis on individual authority over interpretation and the necessity of sure knowledge/experience of salvation. Second, and related, is the collapse of sacred distance. This one is a bit more complicated than Givens’ goes into – while he uses this to denote the breakdown between the categories of sacred and secular in Mormonism, with men becoming gods and God becoming like men, I am more interested in the reaching for connection with the divine, the efforts to bridge the distance between sacred and secular and to increase the experience of the sacred. Third, and again related, is the search for a sure experience, for something known and undoubtable. This type of search has parallels in the philosophical works of the day and while searching for assurance is well documented in studies of Puritan New England, there appears to be a particular crisis of knowledge being reacted against. And fourth is the primitivist impulse, the desire to go back to some unpolluted point and to recreate the world based upon that pure model.</p>

  <p>So, this week was both productive and not. I find that I learn in circles – I have to go over things about 3 times for connections between things to get to the point that I feel like I have learned something. (They told us this in philosophy too –  read it 3 times to understand what is going on. Now, if they assigned the same thing 3 times …)</p>

<p>Anyway, in light of this pattern, I went back to some tutorials. I spent too much time on the first 17 tutorials of “<a href="http://learnpythonthehardway.org/">Learn Python the Hard Way</a>” and then, because I got a bit distractable at that point, did the first 13 of “<a href="http://sql.learncodethehardway.org/">Learn SQL the Hard Way</a>.” (I have a feeling <a href="http://regex.learncodethehardway.org/book/">“Learn Regex…”</a> is in my future …)</p>

<p>At any rate, the SQL tutorials were really helpful in a, “well, duh. I should’ve picked up on that” sort of way. So I tweaked my pages to have one query for showing both text and author information, which is super useful and makes everything much cleaner and less confusing. I’ll push that up to my server so to update <a href="http://clio3.jeriwieringa.com">clio3.jeriwieringa.com</a>.</p>

<p>There is still more to do with that, but I got distracted again by all of the files I pulled down last week. (seriously, grad school is turning me into a goldfish… ) At any rate, there was a small problem that most of the 2000 files that I pulled down were 2 bytes large. (they contained an empty array).</p>

<p>So, with much googling, I worked out a bash script to delete all of the really small files. yup.</p>

<pre>find *.json -size -28c | xargs rm</pre>

<p>I was in folder already so no file path necessary. Anyway, this deleted all of the files that ended with .json and were smaller than 28 bytes. I tried with 2 bytes, but it was hiccup-ing.</p>

<p>Then I realized I needed to parse out the hymnal IDs so I know which hymnal information to add to my database. (Good news – there is place info in the hymnal CSV file. It’s not going to tell me all that much, but it’s enough to get a sense of where the publishing centers are. And it gives me something to map.) And that’s where I’ve slowed to a halt.</p>

<p>I am having trouble getting my head around working with these json files. I know it’s been explained to me many times, and I know it’s an array of arrays, but I just can’t seem to find a basic intro to the syntax for working with it. So that is where I could use the most help this week.</p>

  <p>This week I have focused on learning some of the tricks and tips for scraping websites, in preparation for presenting tonight. For the most part, this has gone really well. The existing tutorials on the programming historian for using <a href="http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/automated-downloading-with-wget">wget</a> and <a href="http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/working-with-files-and-web-pages">python</a> are very intuitive and easy to follow and most of my presentation will be on these.</p>

<p>Wget is a very useful tool when dealing with a well organized website and I think will be most useful right of the bat for most of us. It’s quick and easy and run through the command line.</p>

<p>Using Python is a bit more complicated but does allow for more detailed scraping. While I won’t be focusing on this, you can use Python to not only pull down whole copies of sites but also to filter those sites for particular information before you save it to your own machine (or wherever you’re saving it).</p>

<p>One problem I am still struggling with is how to cycle through a list of URL using Python. While writing the script to save one file is straightforward enough, I spent much of yesterday looking for any indication of how to save multiple files. I kinda have a loop going on, but can’t figure out if it is parsing my csv file of links correctly. And I can’t figure out how to change the file name each time, so even when I get something out, it is rewriting itself in a single file. If I can’t figure this out today (and I’m coming for help with this, Fred), I think I can present a work-around using cURL.</p>

<p>Also, it is unclear to me how to build in a wait time when using Python or cURL. Seems that this would be useful in order to be a good internet citizen.</p>

<p>Two discoveries as a result of this. 1. Hymnary.org puts a cap on the calls to the api from a given ip address. <img src="http://jeriwieringa.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> oops. and 2. There is a ton more information in the json document that I am looking to call down than I had realized. I think I will be able to do more this semester than I originally thought my data allowed. yippie!!</p>

  <p>The readings this week are a somewhat eclectic collection of readings relating to religion and women in the west. Since I am keeping the more detailed notes in handwritten form this week, the texts were: Sarah Deutsch, <em>No Separate Refuge</em>; Devon Mihesuah, <em>Cultivating the Rosebuds</em>; Ramón Gutiérrez, <em>When Jesus Came, the Corn Mothers Went Away</em>; and Peggy Pascoe, <em>Relations of Rescue</em>.</p>

<p>One of the recurring features of these works is the tendency to use yet again the rhetoric of “separate spheres” and the “cult” of “womanhood.” In these text, references were usually deployed to complicate the ideas of separate spheres but of often relied on ideas of domesticity and the cult of womanhood. It is not hard to see why: from the rhetoric of Pascoe’s late 19th century female reformers to the ideas about race and gender taught and emulated by Cherokee students, it does seem that ideals about gender and domesticity formed a large part of the framework that shaped many women’s experience during the 19th century. Given the readings from last week, however, it is interesting to me how resilient the language of separate spheres is. Even when mentioned to show how it fails, the theme of spheres seems embedded in the historians subconscious in ways that are perhaps veering toward being more revealing of the present than of the past. Perhaps …</p>

<p>The two pieces that were most obviously dissertations, <em>Cultivating the Rosebuds</em> and <em>No Separate Refuge </em>were interesting to read as examples of types of studies that can be done as dissertation projects. Mihesuah’s piece was encouraging in its narrow focus, although many of the theoretical questions regarding the construction of race and gender were left underdeveloped. Deutsch’s piece, on the other hand, presented an intimidating picture of the dissertation project, as her area of study and her questions were much wider in scope and broader in implication. On the other hand, her study, which focuses on Chicano, and particularly Chicana, strategies for maintaining cultural integrity in the face of Anglo-American culture, offers a more nuanced and positive depiction of the role of women in Hispanic American culture than had previously existed. Her’s is instructive of how preconceived ideas about cultural structures can obstruct the view of different strategies for exercising authority, something that I will also need to keep in mind while studying women in religious movements.</p>

<p>Also, as a side note, Deutsch’s piece offers some interesting possibilities for geo-spatial analysis, as she is describing community networks that span great distances and are changing over time.</p>

<p>Pascoe’s piece also touches on the dangers inherent in assuming a singular vision of “female culture.” While her work is motivated by current concerns about the programs of cultural feminists, she grounds her concerns by examining the similar reform efforts of Protestant women during the late 19th century. The women she studies open houses of refuge with the goal of female uplift and challenging patriarchy, however, they do so by assuming the centrality of “purity and piety” to all women. The result is a complicated story that throws the relationship between gender, race, and class into sharp relief.</p>

<p>Gutiérrez’s piece was one that I was excited to read but a bit disappointed with for my current purposes. The central part of his investigation focuses on the 17th and 18th centuries, with minimal gesturing toward the 19th. His centering of Pueblo and Acoma origin myths provides an interesting contrast to approaches such as Daniel Richter’s <em>Facing East from Indian Country</em> and offers a useful picture of native cosmology prior to Spanish conquest. However, much of his analysis is focused on drawing a stark distinction between the centrality of sexuality to Pueblo culture and the sexual repression he identifies as guiding Spanish Catholicism. The sections of the book that focus on his central question of how marriage structured social inequality focuses largely on Spanish and Spanish colonials marriages.</p>

<p>In all, these books offer pictures of the complicated processes by which gender is described and prescribed.</p>
