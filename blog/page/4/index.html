  <p>So, this week was both productive and not. I find that I learn in circles – I have to go over things about 3 times for connections between things to get to the point that I feel like I have learned something. (They told us this in philosophy too –  read it 3 times to understand what is going on. Now, if they assigned the same thing 3 times …)</p>

<p>Anyway, in light of this pattern, I went back to some tutorials. I spent too much time on the first 17 tutorials of “<a href="http://learnpythonthehardway.org/">Learn Python the Hard Way</a>” and then, because I got a bit distractable at that point, did the first 13 of “<a href="http://sql.learncodethehardway.org/">Learn SQL the Hard Way</a>.” (I have a feeling <a href="http://regex.learncodethehardway.org/book/">“Learn Regex…”</a> is in my future …)</p>

<p>At any rate, the SQL tutorials were really helpful in a, “well, duh. I should’ve picked up on that” sort of way. So I tweaked my pages to have one query for showing both text and author information, which is super useful and makes everything much cleaner and less confusing. I’ll push that up to my server so to update <a href="http://clio3.jeriwieringa.com">clio3.jeriwieringa.com</a>.</p>

<p>There is still more to do with that, but I got distracted again by all of the files I pulled down last week. (seriously, grad school is turning me into a goldfish… ) At any rate, there was a small problem that most of the 2000 files that I pulled down were 2 bytes large. (they contained an empty array).</p>

<p>So, with much googling, I worked out a bash script to delete all of the really small files. yup.</p>

<pre>find *.json -size -28c | xargs rm</pre>

<p>I was in folder already so no file path necessary. Anyway, this deleted all of the files that ended with .json and were smaller than 28 bytes. I tried with 2 bytes, but it was hiccup-ing.</p>

<p>Then I realized I needed to parse out the hymnal IDs so I know which hymnal information to add to my database. (Good news – there is place info in the hymnal CSV file. It’s not going to tell me all that much, but it’s enough to get a sense of where the publishing centers are. And it gives me something to map.) And that’s where I’ve slowed to a halt.</p>

<p>I am having trouble getting my head around working with these json files. I know it’s been explained to me many times, and I know it’s an array of arrays, but I just can’t seem to find a basic intro to the syntax for working with it. So that is where I could use the most help this week.</p>

  <p>This week I have focused on learning some of the tricks and tips for scraping websites, in preparation for presenting tonight. For the most part, this has gone really well. The existing tutorials on the programming historian for using <a href="http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/automated-downloading-with-wget">wget</a> and <a href="http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/working-with-files-and-web-pages">python</a> are very intuitive and easy to follow and most of my presentation will be on these.</p>

<p>Wget is a very useful tool when dealing with a well organized website and I think will be most useful right of the bat for most of us. It’s quick and easy and run through the command line.</p>

<p>Using Python is a bit more complicated but does allow for more detailed scraping. While I won’t be focusing on this, you can use Python to not only pull down whole copies of sites but also to filter those sites for particular information before you save it to your own machine (or wherever you’re saving it).</p>

<p>One problem I am still struggling with is how to cycle through a list of URL using Python. While writing the script to save one file is straightforward enough, I spent much of yesterday looking for any indication of how to save multiple files. I kinda have a loop going on, but can’t figure out if it is parsing my csv file of links correctly. And I can’t figure out how to change the file name each time, so even when I get something out, it is rewriting itself in a single file. If I can’t figure this out today (and I’m coming for help with this, Fred), I think I can present a work-around using cURL.</p>

<p>Also, it is unclear to me how to build in a wait time when using Python or cURL. Seems that this would be useful in order to be a good internet citizen.</p>

<p>Two discoveries as a result of this. 1. Hymnary.org puts a cap on the calls to the api from a given ip address. <img src="http://jeriwieringa.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> oops. and 2. There is a ton more information in the json document that I am looking to call down than I had realized. I think I will be able to do more this semester than I originally thought my data allowed. yippie!!</p>

  <p>The readings this week are a somewhat eclectic collection of readings relating to religion and women in the west. Since I am keeping the more detailed notes in handwritten form this week, the texts were: Sarah Deutsch, <em>No Separate Refuge</em>; Devon Mihesuah, <em>Cultivating the Rosebuds</em>; Ramón Gutiérrez, <em>When Jesus Came, the Corn Mothers Went Away</em>; and Peggy Pascoe, <em>Relations of Rescue</em>.</p>

<p>One of the recurring features of these works is the tendency to use yet again the rhetoric of “separate spheres” and the “cult” of “womanhood.” In these text, references were usually deployed to complicate the ideas of separate spheres but of often relied on ideas of domesticity and the cult of womanhood. It is not hard to see why: from the rhetoric of Pascoe’s late 19th century female reformers to the ideas about race and gender taught and emulated by Cherokee students, it does seem that ideals about gender and domesticity formed a large part of the framework that shaped many women’s experience during the 19th century. Given the readings from last week, however, it is interesting to me how resilient the language of separate spheres is. Even when mentioned to show how it fails, the theme of spheres seems embedded in the historians subconscious in ways that are perhaps veering toward being more revealing of the present than of the past. Perhaps …</p>

<p>The two pieces that were most obviously dissertations, <em>Cultivating the Rosebuds</em> and <em>No Separate Refuge </em>were interesting to read as examples of types of studies that can be done as dissertation projects. Mihesuah’s piece was encouraging in its narrow focus, although many of the theoretical questions regarding the construction of race and gender were left underdeveloped. Deutsch’s piece, on the other hand, presented an intimidating picture of the dissertation project, as her area of study and her questions were much wider in scope and broader in implication. On the other hand, her study, which focuses on Chicano, and particularly Chicana, strategies for maintaining cultural integrity in the face of Anglo-American culture, offers a more nuanced and positive depiction of the role of women in Hispanic American culture than had previously existed. Her’s is instructive of how preconceived ideas about cultural structures can obstruct the view of different strategies for exercising authority, something that I will also need to keep in mind while studying women in religious movements.</p>

<p>Also, as a side note, Deutsch’s piece offers some interesting possibilities for geo-spatial analysis, as she is describing community networks that span great distances and are changing over time.</p>

<p>Pascoe’s piece also touches on the dangers inherent in assuming a singular vision of “female culture.” While her work is motivated by current concerns about the programs of cultural feminists, she grounds her concerns by examining the similar reform efforts of Protestant women during the late 19th century. The women she studies open houses of refuge with the goal of female uplift and challenging patriarchy, however, they do so by assuming the centrality of “purity and piety” to all women. The result is a complicated story that throws the relationship between gender, race, and class into sharp relief.</p>

<p>Gutiérrez’s piece was one that I was excited to read but a bit disappointed with for my current purposes. The central part of his investigation focuses on the 17th and 18th centuries, with minimal gesturing toward the 19th. His centering of Pueblo and Acoma origin myths provides an interesting contrast to approaches such as Daniel Richter’s <em>Facing East from Indian Country</em> and offers a useful picture of native cosmology prior to Spanish conquest. However, much of his analysis is focused on drawing a stark distinction between the centrality of sexuality to Pueblo culture and the sexual repression he identifies as guiding Spanish Catholicism. The sections of the book that focus on his central question of how marriage structured social inequality focuses largely on Spanish and Spanish colonials marriages.</p>

<p>In all, these books offer pictures of the complicated processes by which gender is described and prescribed.</p>

  <p>Today I learned the difference between “update” and “insert” and what happens when you update your join table instead of inserting a new entry.</p>

<p>I almost have CRUD – keep finding new things to add/tweak. Also my files are growing increasingly complex to keep track of all of the different ways data is being passed.</p>

<p>Questions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>difference between “object orientated” and “procedural” in the mysqli manual</li>
  <li>when to use “if” for calling a command and when it isn’t necessary – is this just to test that it’s working (so you can have an ‘else’)?</li>
  <li>Can we talk about refactoring?</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>

<p>UPDATE: I have CRUD. (Delete is hidden). available at <a href="http://clio3.jeriwieringa.com/view.php">clio3.jeriwieringa.com/view.php</a></p>
