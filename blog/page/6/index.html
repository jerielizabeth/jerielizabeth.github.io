  <p>In this essay, Joan Scott traces the uses of “gender” as a category of historical analysis, offering both critiques and positive suggestions about the possibilities for further study. She describes two categories of approaches to gender by historians: the first being descriptive, the second causal. Where descriptive approaches tend to focus on relations between the sexes and largely those outside of the world of politics, causal approaches focus on the creation of gender identifies. These fall into three general trends, each with its own weaknesses:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a focus on the origins of patriarchy. (the focus on patriarchy has the unfortunate consequence of ignoring the connections between gender inequality and other inequality, as well as making gender difference a universal, rather than a cultural construct.)</li>
  <li>a Marxist approach that stresses the material causes of gender difference. (but that very focus on material causes limits the analysis and renders gender the result of economic structures, not an independent category.)</li>
  <li>a post-structuralist approach that seeks to explain the production and reproduction of gendered identity, either of the Anglo-American school focused on object-relations and moral development, or the French school focused on readings of Freud and theories of language (1057). (the Anglo-American school focuses on family and household experiences as the sources for gender construction and needs more attention to symbolic systems, while the French school focuses too heavily on “the subject” which results in positing antagonism between males and females as central to gender and results in reductive readings of the past (1064).)</li>
</ul>

<p>Drawing from all of these approaches and attempting to learn from their weaknesses, Scott poses the following definition of gender as a means of framing gender as a category for analysis. According to Scott, gender is a constitutive element of social relationships based upon perceived difference, which consists of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>culturally available symbols that evoke multiple and contradictory representations of gender,</li>
  <li>normative concepts that set forth interpretations of the meanings of the symbols and limit metaphoric possibilities,</li>
  <li>a notion of politics and reference to social institutions and organizations,</li>
  <li>subjective identity, which needs to be explored in historically contingent ways,</li>
</ul>

<p>as well as the primary way of signifying relationships of power (1067 ff). Where the first point, with its four part points to places for historical investigation, the second – the relationship between gender and power – marks the theorizing about gender (1069).</p>

<p>By focusing on gender in these terms, Scott proposes that historians can better explore both individual subjects and social organizations to understand how gender works and how changes in the construction of gender and power can and do occur (1067).</p>

  <p>Higginbotham’s essay discusses the silence about race and class that has marked much of the theoretical work about gender and the work of feminist scholars. She argues for bringing race into the analysis of power by 1) defining the “construction and ‘technologies’ of race,” 2) exposing race as a metalanguage and 3) revealing race as a site of dialogic exchange and contestation (252). She argues that race is central to the construction of gender, particularly in societies were racial demarcation is basic to social structure (254). Her essay works to explore the concept of race, to unpack the centrality of race in the construction of gender, class and sexuality, and ends by discussing race as “double-voiced discourse,” as both the voice of oppression and of liberation. Her work argues that there is no singular or homogenous experience of women but that race and class both shape and are shaped by conceptions of gender.</p>

  <!-- use article.summary(250) if you have Nokogiri available to show just

  <p>Durkheim sets out in <em>Elementary Forms </em> to uncover the truth or reality behind “the religious nature of man”(1). (And in this case, man may be appropriately gendered – it is unclear from the selections I read how women are religious if they are identified with the profane.) His method for addressing this question is to begin with the “simplest and most primitive religion” and to uncover from there the universal structures of religious experience(1). He chooses totemism as his primitive religion and works from the particular practices of Australian Aborigines to the idea of <em>Mana</em>, which is the physical force and moral power undergirding totemic life and, he claims, all religions (201). <em>Mana</em> then is explained as society itself — the social experience is the source for the experience of moral power and collective emotion. That experience is then associated with particular items, and those items become “sacred.”</p>

<p>Some points of note:</p>

<ul>
  <li>He distinguishes “magic” from “religion” by claiming that magic is individual and seeking particular advantage in the world where religion is social, the collective representation of collective realities (9).</li>
  <li>He insists on a sharp dualism between the sacred and the profane, claiming that beliefs divide the world into these two categories and that much of religious practice is maintaining that separation. (Interestingly, it is the sacred that is contagious - the concern seems to be that if everything becomes sacred, nothing is sacred … unsure here).</li>
  <li>In the conclusion, religious practices, or the cult, is described as “the sum total of means by which that faith is created and recreated periodically” (420).</li>
  <li>Durkheim is definitely building upon Kant, particular the his ideas surrounding space/time and his emphasis on the role of morality in religion. Durkheim attributes the source of these things in the social.</li>
  <li>I am unsure, but it seems that the roots for the idea of civil religion can be found here.</li>
</ul>

<p>While I am uncomfortable with Durkheim’s approach (any search for essence makes me nervous) and his goal to explain religion and religious experience in natural and horizontal terms, his descriptions about the power of the social and the experience of the social raise some intriguing questions. There is something very powerful about social gatherings for a single purpose, as seen in the heightened religious experience often recorded at extended revivals. Camp meetings and innovations in religious experiences that come out of them could be explored along these lines.</p>

<p>I am also curious as to where Protestant, and particularly Calvinist, religious practice fits into Durkheim’s scheme. It is unclear to me where a religion that insists on the sacredness of all labor and the everyday would fit when sacred and profane are described as opposing and needing to be kept separate.</p>

  <p>In this essay, Smith-Rosenberg investigates the structure of radical religious movements, movements that challenge the prevailing social order. Her primary example is the religious revivals of the 19th century and her main focus is on explaining why these movements seem to be especially appealing to women.</p>

<p>She refers to movements such as these as periods of “religious anti-ritualism,” a concept she develops from the work of Mary Douglas. She notes that periods of anti-ritualism tend to correspond with periods of social change and can be understood as a “social language” to express social experiences (137-9).</p>

<p>To answer the question of why women were particularly attracted to religious anti-ritualism, Smith-Rosenberg draws on the theoretical work of Victor Turner and the structure of “rites of passage” that he identifies. She identifies periods of revival as periods of disorder between systems of order, while acknowledging that these had their own ritualistic form. She describes them as “liminal” periods, as periods where roles and power are renegotiated and when those on the margins of society are able to claim some amount of power. Women, she argues, are always marginal, and so find anti-revivalism more appealing and often remain in the anti-revival mode longer than others.</p>

  <p>Smith-Rosenberg investigates the ways sexuality was constructed in the 19th century and particularly at the relationships between women. She describes a world that is largely homosocial, where the primary relationships for each gender was located among others of the same gender. These relationships were both intimate and socially acceptable, fitting with no apparent contradiction with the societal push for women to assume roles as wives and mothers.</p>

<p>While this description seems connected to the idea of “separate spheres,” the idea that men and women had distinct social sphere raises some interesting questions. For one, it would be interesting to look at conversion patterns in terms of these homosocial networks, rather than families. Also, the discussion of female social worlds needs a corresponding discussion of male social worlds and the prevalence of fraternal societies during this period.</p>

<p>Just as a side note, Smith-Rosenberg seems to describe this sort of social relationship as a world long past. However, it is interesting to note that I have seen similar patterns, though less intense, in conservative evangelical subcultures where interactions across the genders is highly regulated.</p>
