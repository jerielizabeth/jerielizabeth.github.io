  <p>Thanks to Sasha’s kind help, my attempts to display my database values have progress a few baby-steps further.</p>

<p>The “show” page is showing the data from both the person and the text table. Next step is adding the “add author” form under the display of author data and to add a link to “edit” either author or text (or maybe both in one form … thoughts…).</p>

<p>So it’s in its most recent form at <a href="http://clio3.jeriwieringa.com/view.php">clio3.jeriwieringa.com/view.php</a></p>

  <!-- use article.summary(250) if you have Nokogiri available to show just

  <p>The idea behind theory week was to pull together a plethora of resources for thinking systematically about both religion and gender, resources that will be used in the upcoming weeks to analyze the historical accounts and will be harnessed for reading texts that do not directly address questions of gender in a gender-focused way.</p>

<p>These texts fall into two general categories (though these overlap and inform one another in, of course, interesting ways): reading from sociology and anthropology, focusing largely on questions of religion but also on questions of social structures, and readings from cultural theory and gender studies that focus on the construction of gender.</p>

<p>One of the largest contrasts I felt in this combination of readings was the tension between the structuralist impulse of the sociologists and the post-structuralist impulse of the gender theorists. Where Durkheim, Turner, and Weber are looking for basic and fundamental structures of human experience, theorists such as Scott, Smith-Rosenberg, and Butler emphasize the contingency and constructed nature of patterns as seemingly basic as gender. I find the idea that gender is not “natural” but constructed and performative to be very persuasive, which makes me even less comfortable with Durkheim’s positing society and the experience of society as the source of religion.</p>

<p>While there is something very interesting about the idea of experience of a collective consciousness as enlightening, empowering, and the rest, it concerns me that his analysis is as tidy as it is. While religion on his account is completely natural and reasonable, it also has very little transcendence. There is some – the experience of the social lifts the individual beyond his/her self – but still, that’s rather horizontal. While Durkheim would respond that he has identified the structure that gives rise to feelings of transcendence and that more elaborate interpretations are just mistaking the experience for something larger, I personally find this explanation/response results in the majority of people being deceived by their religious beliefs. And that is an unappealing place to start from.</p>

<p>Note for Sharon: I have yet to write up a piece for Douglas and Weber. Douglas is just an issue of time – I will get to that shortly. Weber, on the other hand, is defeating me. What is a rational economy? My best guess is that he is referring to objective or disinterested economic relationships. I am not sure what the goal of “Religious Rejections of the World” is.</p>

<p>From what I have gotten from him, it seems that Weber’s theory is aimed at making sense of Protestant (and specifically Calvinist) religious practice where Durkheim is more focused on Catholic (and liturgical) religious practice. Does that sound right?</p>

  <p>Kerber investigates the place of women within the rhetoric and ideology of the Enlightenment. She notes that Enlightenment thinker rarely considered women with theorizing about civic culture and, with a few notable exceptions including Adam Smith, when they did, tended to do so negatively. She argues that women were only considered as wives and mothers, with no mechanism for influencing government. The concept of the “Republican Mother” arose in the American environment as a way to integrate domesticity and politics. In this role, women were “deferential” citizens (59) with limited influence but not strictly excluded. Instead, women remained in a deferential phase of politicization where men in the early republic moved away from deference.</p>

  <p>Kerber’s pieces is an historiographical essay on the concept of “separate sphere” in the telling of women’s history. She identifies 3 stages of the understanding of separate spheres, from the early work of Barbara Welter, Gerda Lerner, and Aileen S. Kraditor that focused on identifying separate spheres as a central theme of women’s experience, through the work of Carroll Smith-Rosenberg and Nancy Cott that focused introduced complexities and the possibilities of women’s culture, to what Kerber identifies as the current 3rd stage that focuses both on how the women’s sphere was “socially constructed both for and by women” and how women’s sphere affected and shaped men’s activities (169-171).</p>

<p>She also notes three characteristics of the 3rd (and current) stage of the use of the metaphor of separate spheres. These are 1) that the concept of “separate spheres” is applicable across the history of human experience, that it’s not just a 19th century phenomena, 2) that it is characterized by more attention to social relations and sees separate spheres as changing response to changing social and economic realities (175) and 3) that attention is being payed to the literal spaces women occupied and shaped.</p>

  <p><em>Gender Trouble</em> is a theoretical inquiry into gender that seeks to open possibilities for the ways gender manifests, or in her terms, is performed, rather than to prescribe a definitive account of what constitutes “gender.” Her work is drawing on the tradition of French philosophy, largely of an anti-structuralist vein, and challenges all foundationalist approaches to questions of gender and persons by arguing that gender is both performed and performative – that gender is something individuals perform and that gender, in the performance, constitutes “the identity it is purported to be” (33). She also challenges the idea that, while gender may be a culturally constructed interpretation, sex is natural and naturally binary. Instead, she argues that sex is also constructed, and constructed through the “apparatus” of gender (11).</p>

<p>This text is very rich in content and very dense in presentation (which Butler brilliantly defends by noting that language itself is not a neutral medium for conveying meaning). Her conclusion for the challenging of gender binaries is both a recognition that no individual can escape the existing framework or power structures (there is no objective outside place from which one can argue), but that those power structures can be challenged and revealed as arbitrary through subversion, through performing gender in such a way that calls attention to the framework’s logic and challenges its status as “natural” and necessary.</p>
