  <p>Today I learned the difference between “update” and “insert” and what happens when you update your join table instead of inserting a new entry.</p>

<p>I almost have CRUD – keep finding new things to add/tweak. Also my files are growing increasingly complex to keep track of all of the different ways data is being passed.</p>

<p>Questions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>difference between “object orientated” and “procedural” in the mysqli manual</li>
  <li>when to use “if” for calling a command and when it isn’t necessary – is this just to test that it’s working (so you can have an ‘else’)?</li>
  <li>Can we talk about refactoring?</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>

<p>UPDATE: I have CRUD. (Delete is hidden). available at <a href="http://clio3.jeriwieringa.com/view.php">clio3.jeriwieringa.com/view.php</a></p>

  <!-- use article.summary(250) if you have Nokogiri available to show just
       the first 250 characters -->
  <p>In the manner of sociologists and anthropologists, Victor Turner is investigating structures of human behavior by analyzing the practices and rituals of “simpler” societies.  In “Betwixt and Between,” he is investigating rites of passage, the cultural practices surrounding the movement from one state (any type of stable or recurrent condition that is culturally recognized (94)) to another. This transition includes separation, margin, and aggregation. Most of his attention is focused on the marginal, or liminal, period where, he notes, many standard social markers, including sex distinctions, do not apply (97). In addition, during the liminal period for the culture he studies, the neophyte is taught what Turner refers to as the <em>sacra</em>, the cosmology and mythical history of the people (103). This teaching of the <em>sacra </em>involves 1) the reduction of culture into recognized components, often through exaggeration of the integral aspects of culture or the body, 2) the recombination of those components in monstrous patterns or shapes, which further draws attention to the various components now removed from their usual context, and 3) the recombination of components in ways that fit the new state and status of the neophyte (106).</p>

<p>In Turner’s description, the liminal person is in transition from one culturally recognized state to another, and this transitional period helps to prepare them for assuming the responsibilities of the upcoming state. It is striking that this very particular account of transition rituals has been expanded so broadly in cultural theory and has been extended to include persons are perpetually “liminal” — always in transition between two states but never able to enter the next or return to the previous.</p>

  <p>Thanks to Sasha’s kind help, my attempts to display my database values have progress a few baby-steps further.</p>

<p>The “show” page is showing the data from both the person and the text table. Next step is adding the “add author” form under the display of author data and to add a link to “edit” either author or text (or maybe both in one form … thoughts…).</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/2012/09/27/reflections-for-theory-week.html">Reflections for &#8220;Theory Week&#8221;</a>, <span>27 Sep 2012</span></h2>
  <!-- use article.summary(250) if you have Nokogiri available to show just
       the first 250 characters -->
  <p>The idea behind theory week was to pull together a plethora of resources for thinking systematically about both religion and gender, resources that will be used in the upcoming weeks to analyze the historical accounts and will be harnessed for reading texts that do not directly address questions of gender in a gender-focused way.</p>

<p>These texts fall into two general categories (though these overlap and inform one another in, of course, interesting ways): reading from sociology and anthropology, focusing largely on questions of religion but also on questions of social structures, and readings from cultural theory and gender studies that focus on the construction of gender.</p>

<p>One of the largest contrasts I felt in this combination of readings was the tension between the structuralist impulse of the sociologists and the post-structuralist impulse of the gender theorists. Where Durkheim, Turner, and Weber are looking for basic and fundamental structures of human experience, theorists such as Scott, Smith-Rosenberg, and Butler emphasize the contingency and constructed nature of patterns as seemingly basic as gender. I find the idea that gender is not “natural” but constructed and performative to be very persuasive, which makes me even less comfortable with Durkheim’s positing society and the experience of society as the source of religion.</p>

<p>While there is something very interesting about the idea of experience of a collective consciousness as enlightening, empowering, and the rest, it concerns me that his analysis is as tidy as it is. While religion on his account is completely natural and reasonable, it also has very little transcendence. There is some – the experience of the social lifts the individual beyond his/her self – but still, that’s rather horizontal. While Durkheim would respond that he has identified the structure that gives rise to feelings of transcendence and that more elaborate interpretations are just mistaking the experience for something larger, I personally find this explanation/response results in the majority of people being deceived by their religious beliefs. And that is an unappealing place to start from.</p>

<p>Note for Sharon: I have yet to write up a piece for Douglas and Weber. Douglas is just an issue of time – I will get to that shortly. Weber, on the other hand, is defeating me. What is a rational economy? My best guess is that he is referring to objective or disinterested economic relationships. I am not sure what the goal of “Religious Rejections of the World” is.</p>

<p>From what I have gotten from him, it seems that Weber’s theory is aimed at making sense of Protestant (and specifically Calvinist) religious practice where Durkheim is more focused on Catholic (and liturgical) religious practice. Does that sound right?</p>

  <!-- use article.summary(250) if you have Nokogiri available to show just

  <p>Kerber investigates the place of women within the rhetoric and ideology of the Enlightenment. She notes that Enlightenment thinker rarely considered women with theorizing about civic culture and, with a few notable exceptions including Adam Smith, when they did, tended to do so negatively. She argues that women were only considered as wives and mothers, with no mechanism for influencing government. The concept of the “Republican Mother” arose in the American environment as a way to integrate domesticity and politics. In this role, women were “deferential” citizens (59) with limited influence but not strictly excluded. Instead, women remained in a deferential phase of politicization where men in the early republic moved away from deference.</p>
