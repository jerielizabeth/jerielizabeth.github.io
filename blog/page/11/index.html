  <p>This week was more of a “big picture” week for me, thus the half step towards the type assignment. I focused most of my “Clio” brain power this week on website organization, on tracking down possible comparison sites for my project, on thinking about layout, and on searching for fonts. Project Canterbury is a very text heavy site and as such my choices in fonts will be particularly noticeable. This also makes my choice a bit complicated, as the font has to both go with the material, which is largely 19th-century documents, and has to be readable on-screen. Thanks to<a href="http://meganrbrett.net/blog/2012/02/h697-seeking-out-new-worlds/"> Megan’s suggestion</a>, I am  looking at fonts from the <a href="http://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/">League of Moveable Type</a>, particularly <a href="http://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/fanwood">Fanwood </a>for more focused reading sections, and <a href="http://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/sorts-mill-goudy">Sorts Mill Goudy</a>. These fonts seem to strike a good balance between referencing the older type of the primary material and being readable on the screen. Now to find a good decorative font to accompany them.</p>

<p>In terms of sites that take on similar projects, I spent some time this week looking at the Willa Cather archive and the Walt Whitman archive. Both of these sites deal with a large amount of text and I found them helpful for organizing my thoughts about what my site needs to accomplish. While both sites have their weaknesses, particularly in terms of design, their approach to organizing the data was particularly helpful.</p>

<p>The resources for this week were helpful in pointing to ways CSS3 gives additional control over the appearance of the site and for pointing to resources for finding and properly calling on fonts. There seem to be a number of resources for creating a well-formatted @font-family stack. It is just a little unfortunate that the lack of standardization results in such a variety of file formats and no guarantee that what we want will appear on the screen of our users. Ah well. Graceful degradation, I believe, is the term for what we want to insure, so at least the site is useable even if IE is determined to have its own way.</p>

<p>On to putting these fonts to work!</p>

  <p>To be honest, typography scares me. I mean, it looks great and I understand why it is important and that you can do many things with typography to make your text interesting. But books on typography seem to enjoy highlighting the numerous ways people use typography poorly or focus on overused and reviled typefaces but rarely explain why (but I like Papyrus…). It is enough to cause me much anxiety. I don’t know enough to avoid the mistakes and end up feeling that it is all rather arbitrary.</p>

<p>Left brain.</p>

<p>However I will attempt to understand this strange new world and will attempt to experiment with type in my next assignments. Just please don’t laugh too loudly at my gaffs.</p>

<p>I do know that the project I will be working on will require a more traditional typography, something that invokes religious copy from the 18th and 19th centuries. I would also, however, like add some tension and flair by adding some more modern layout elements, something to avoid being overly cliche and to add some visual interest to the site.</p>

<p>Another helpful resource for design, particularly if anyone else is painfully analytical and lacking in design sense, is <em>Design for Hackers</em> by David Kadavy. It explains <strong>why</strong> Comic Sans is a problematic font and assumes that design is not your first language. Very helpful for the anxious analytic brain.</p>

<p>Also, the final section in <em>Thinking with Type</em> discussed grids but was very vague about the application of grids to the web. I am interested in experimenting with a grid system for web-design. I have looked at <a href="http://blueprintcss.org/">blueprint</a> and the <a href="http://960.gs/">960 grid system</a> and am leaning toward the 960 grid system. Is anyone interested in experimenting with me?</p>

  <p>So the first iteration of my portfolio is live.</p>

<p>Well, not the first.</p>

<p>More like the 10th.</p>

<p>But the first that I’m willing to go live with.</p>

<p>Some outstanding issues that I am still working on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>getting the sidebar to fill in to equal length with the content section.</li>
  <li>the footer needs to be narrower – but there is something funky with the “badges” that is adding padding or margins.</li>
  <li>manipulating the CSS for the links! This one I am completely stuck on. I’ve tried a couple of things, but they either don’t work, or don’t work like I expect. Also, I would love to have links in the sidebar, but I can’t seem to create separate styling, so both the nav bar and the sidebar links are either black or my background grey. Which means one of them is unintelligible.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can find it at<a href="http://jeriwieringa.com/portfolio/index.html"> jeriwieringa.com/portfolio</a></p>

<p>If you have any ideas or suggestions, please let me know! Also if anyone has IE, could you tell me how it looks? <img src="http://jeriwieringa.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>

<p>*update: apparently I should have watched the typography tutorials earlier – I think the key to different styles for links may be there.</p>

  <!-- use article.summary(250) if you have Nokogiri available to show just

  <p><em>[This post is for week 1 of History and New Media]</em></p>

<p>The readings from today’s class were a helpful reminder that, at the very least, it is as much how you say it as what you say. Content may be king, but if you present your content in a way that is frustrating, illogical, or visually immature, you undermine your content.</p>

<p>From my experience, work done in the humanities is both already very aware of modes of presentation, and also very un-reflective upon those modes of presentation. There is a high value placed on properly formatted footnotes and citation styles, and the format of papers is largely dictated from ‘above’. Those formats are to be transgressed at ones own peril. So while we pay a lot of attention to formatting our work to the academic standards for print, we don’t spend much time thinking about whether those standards are most conducive for presenting our content. And because our standard formats are aimed at print presentations, we are able to get away with not thinking about the connections between content and presentation.</p>

<p>But the web is not print. And the same standard formatting and presentation elements that are acceptable in print are detrimental to web-based content.</p>

<p>This is where digital humanities becomes exciting to me, because it offers a chance to rethink the standard modes for presenting content and, at the same time, offers the opportunity for different types of content to be created and presented.</p>

<p>While all of the readings for this week were interesting and argued for the value of and need for focused attention on design in the creation of web content, the two I found most productive to place in conversation were Donald Norman’s “<a href="http://www.jnd.org/ED_Draft/CH01.pdf">Attractive Things Work Better</a>“[pdf] and the <a href="www.consumerwebwatch.org/dynamic/web-credibility-reports-evaluate-abstract.cfm">Consumer Reports study</a> on how people evaluate a web site’s credibility. If Norman is correct in his description of human mental functions, that we use our cognitive abilities to assign meaning and our affective responses to assign value, we may have a clue as to why people rely upon design to assess credibility. A well designed site puts us at ease and reduces focus, we are less likely to scrutinize the content and are more likely to engage with the content presented. A poorly designed site, according to the same logic, would put the user ill at ease, increase his or her focus, and that user would both be more critical and less receptive to the content being communicated.</p>

<p>On the one hand, while I think that this is plausible, it makes me realize just how gullible or easily rigged the human decision making and value-assigning process is. But that aside, it makes it all the more important that those with strong historical content create sites that are well designed, lest they be dismissed because of their presentation. Just as a paper with sloppy footnotes and formatting is less likely to be taken seriously, so too a website that does not conform to basic principles of design is less likely to be seen as authoritative. So on to learning this new set of presentation guidelines and standards for the world of the web!</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/2011/12/23/thoughts-on-scholarship.html">Thoughts on Scholarship</a>, <span>23 Dec 2011</span></h2>
  <!-- use article.summary(250) if you have Nokogiri available to show just
       the first 250 characters -->
  <p>There was an <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/Fast-Food-Scholarship/130049">advice article in the Chronicle</a> by Lynn Worsham recently that caught my attention. Worsham observes that an increasing number of articles and manuscripts submitted for publication in the journal where she works and other presses that she reviews for are, what she calls, “Fast Food scholarship.” Fast food scholarship aims to fulfill the publishing requirement but is not carefully researched, not well developed, and not in conversation with other recent scholarship.</p>

<p>It strikes me that, while I agree that the prevalence of quickly written and substandard scholarship is problematic, this type of writing is what graduate school pushes us toward. While the ideal student would structure their work so that they could write multiple drafts for seminar papers and the like, that ideal is challenging if not impossible. The reading load is such that “skimming” is the preferred from of graduate reading, but it seems to me that this limits our ability to engage deeply with other authors’ arguments. We read widely so that we can sound intelligent but we do not read deeply. Our writing is done quickly, often with little feedback and there is no requirement to revisit it or improve upon it.</p>

<p>If graduate school is for professional development and is there to teach us how to engage in the academic world, then I think the problem identified by Worsham is a problem that begins in the structure of our education. I would love to have time to think deeply about my arguments, to revise and restructure, to read thoroughly and really engage with other scholarship on the topic. But what is rewarded is being prolific and quick, and the writing style that we learn results in quantity but not quality. Since the work load and publishing requirements are just as heavy after graduate school, how does one create the space and time to do the deeply engaged scholarship that is worth reading?</p>
