  <p>So the first iteration of my portfolio is live.</p>

<p>Well, not the first.</p>

<p>More like the 10th.</p>

<p>But the first that I’m willing to go live with.</p>

<p>Some outstanding issues that I am still working on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>getting the sidebar to fill in to equal length with the content section.</li>
  <li>the footer needs to be narrower – but there is something funky with the “badges” that is adding padding or margins.</li>
  <li>manipulating the CSS for the links! This one I am completely stuck on. I’ve tried a couple of things, but they either don’t work, or don’t work like I expect. Also, I would love to have links in the sidebar, but I can’t seem to create separate styling, so both the nav bar and the sidebar links are either black or my background grey. Which means one of them is unintelligible.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can find it at<a href="http://jeriwieringa.com/portfolio/index.html"> jeriwieringa.com/portfolio</a></p>

<p>If you have any ideas or suggestions, please let me know! Also if anyone has IE, could you tell me how it looks? <img src="http://jeriwieringa.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>

<p>*update: apparently I should have watched the typography tutorials earlier – I think the key to different styles for links may be there.</p>

  <p><em>[This post is for week 1 of History and New Media]</em></p>

<p>The readings from today’s class were a helpful reminder that, at the very least, it is as much how you say it as what you say. Content may be king, but if you present your content in a way that is frustrating, illogical, or visually immature, you undermine your content.</p>

<p>From my experience, work done in the humanities is both already very aware of modes of presentation, and also very un-reflective upon those modes of presentation. There is a high value placed on properly formatted footnotes and citation styles, and the format of papers is largely dictated from ‘above’. Those formats are to be transgressed at ones own peril. So while we pay a lot of attention to formatting our work to the academic standards for print, we don’t spend much time thinking about whether those standards are most conducive for presenting our content. And because our standard formats are aimed at print presentations, we are able to get away with not thinking about the connections between content and presentation.</p>

<p>But the web is not print. And the same standard formatting and presentation elements that are acceptable in print are detrimental to web-based content.</p>

<p>This is where digital humanities becomes exciting to me, because it offers a chance to rethink the standard modes for presenting content and, at the same time, offers the opportunity for different types of content to be created and presented.</p>

<p>While all of the readings for this week were interesting and argued for the value of and need for focused attention on design in the creation of web content, the two I found most productive to place in conversation were Donald Norman’s “<a href="http://www.jnd.org/ED_Draft/CH01.pdf">Attractive Things Work Better</a>“[pdf] and the <a href="www.consumerwebwatch.org/dynamic/web-credibility-reports-evaluate-abstract.cfm">Consumer Reports study</a> on how people evaluate a web site’s credibility. If Norman is correct in his description of human mental functions, that we use our cognitive abilities to assign meaning and our affective responses to assign value, we may have a clue as to why people rely upon design to assess credibility. A well designed site puts us at ease and reduces focus, we are less likely to scrutinize the content and are more likely to engage with the content presented. A poorly designed site, according to the same logic, would put the user ill at ease, increase his or her focus, and that user would both be more critical and less receptive to the content being communicated.</p>

<p>On the one hand, while I think that this is plausible, it makes me realize just how gullible or easily rigged the human decision making and value-assigning process is. But that aside, it makes it all the more important that those with strong historical content create sites that are well designed, lest they be dismissed because of their presentation. Just as a paper with sloppy footnotes and formatting is less likely to be taken seriously, so too a website that does not conform to basic principles of design is less likely to be seen as authoritative. So on to learning this new set of presentation guidelines and standards for the world of the web!</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/2011/12/23/thoughts-on-scholarship.html">Thoughts on Scholarship</a> <span>Dec 23</span></h2>
  <!-- use article.summary(250) if you have Nokogiri available to show just

  <p>There was an <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/Fast-Food-Scholarship/130049">advice article in the Chronicle</a> by Lynn Worsham recently that caught my attention. Worsham observes that an increasing number of articles and manuscripts submitted for publication in the journal where she works and other presses that she reviews for are, what she calls, “Fast Food scholarship.” Fast food scholarship aims to fulfill the publishing requirement but is not carefully researched, not well developed, and not in conversation with other recent scholarship.</p>

<p>It strikes me that, while I agree that the prevalence of quickly written and substandard scholarship is problematic, this type of writing is what graduate school pushes us toward. While the ideal student would structure their work so that they could write multiple drafts for seminar papers and the like, that ideal is challenging if not impossible. The reading load is such that “skimming” is the preferred from of graduate reading, but it seems to me that this limits our ability to engage deeply with other authors’ arguments. We read widely so that we can sound intelligent but we do not read deeply. Our writing is done quickly, often with little feedback and there is no requirement to revisit it or improve upon it.</p>

<p>If graduate school is for professional development and is there to teach us how to engage in the academic world, then I think the problem identified by Worsham is a problem that begins in the structure of our education. I would love to have time to think deeply about my arguments, to revise and restructure, to read thoroughly and really engage with other scholarship on the topic. But what is rewarded is being prolific and quick, and the writing style that we learn results in quantity but not quality. Since the work load and publishing requirements are just as heavy after graduate school, how does one create the space and time to do the deeply engaged scholarship that is worth reading?</p>

  <p>Yes – that is intentionally inverted.</p>

<p>You see, I was converted to “digital” and “new media” before I was converted to history. I was convinced before beginning the class that digital technology makes possible substantial changes on the types of questions we can ask, how scholarship is disseminated, and who makes up the audience for academic work. It was because of these changes that I became interested in the digital humanities in general – it seemed a much needed counter to the growing insularity of traditional scholarship. The weaknesses of traditional scholarship were all to apparent in during my masters degree studies. (The nail in the coffin was students and a professor agreeing that theology was not and should not try to be relevant to religious practitioners; and this was at a Divinity School. Granted it was a class on Schleiermacher – he’s pretty impossible to make relevant.) If scholarship was only for the benefit of other scholars, it was not something I wanted to work on.</p>

<p>The primary aspects of digital scholarship that attracted me were the community emphasis on sharing, on public engagement, on creating things that were useful to someone. Of the humanities, history and particularly public history seemed, to me, to be most committed to those goals and so I decided to locate myself here. Overall, I think it has been a good choice, though one that has required another round of methodological gymnastics on my part.</p>

<p>Because of this, my largest take-away from the course is a better understanding of what it means to be a historian engaged in new media. One point that I am continuing to wrestle with is the importance of narrative in historical scholarship. I am slowly recanting <a href="http://jeriwieringa.wordpress.com/2011/11/16/thoughts-on-directions-for-digital-history/">an earlier renunciation of narrative</a>, and am coming to realize the importance of the story, both for the presentation of the information and for the project of communicating that information to a larger, hopefully interested, public. Data and visualizations are not enough – they must be structured and used to tell a larger story. My current obsession with <a href="http://metamedia.stanford.edu/~mshanks/projects/deep-mapping.html">Deep Mapping</a> is due in part because of the very real potential here to combine narrative with spatial analysis, while encouraging investigation and contribution on the part of the user. So thank you history (and Sharon) for telling me that I cannot simply plot points – I have to plot points in the context of a narrative.</p>

<p>The tradition of public history, I think, will be particularly important as digital scholarship expands, reminding us as scholars of the world outside the ivory tower that we can and should engage. However, that sort of engagement will depend greatly on fighting for open access, for open sourcing data, and the like. Both digital and public history point toward a new paradigm for scholarly activity, one that values public engagement over prestige and exclusivity. I think both face an uphill battle and that they offer one of the better answers to questions about the ongoing value of the humanities.</p>

<p>To answer the question as posed, I think new media changes nothing and changes everything for the project of historical research. History is still engaged with the project of uncovering the past and telling the story of those forgotten or removed from the standard narrative (cultural historian alert). These projects continue in a digital form. However, digital scholarship changes sources, the types of investigations that can be carried out, as well as raises new issues about assumptions within the analytical tools themselves. Digital scholarship is not an “easier” way of investigating the past – I would argue that it requires even more work and maybe even more attention (is that possible) to assumptions at play in data gathering, storing, analysis, and presentation.</p>

<p>My largest question leaving this course regards the implications of digital structures on how we view the world. I am not entirely comfortable with breaking the world into discrete pieces of information. As mentioned by Manovich, digitization is the process of making the world modular, and seems to me to conceive of each piece as independent, though together constituting a whole. However, there are some real questions to be asked about applying such a mode of analysis to human persons – is each individual a discrete element? How would you break an individual down further? Should you? If individuals are not discrete, self-contained elements, which, since I reject an <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/communitarianism/#DebOveSel">atomistic view of persons</a>, I hold, what does this mean for how I “digitize” history? The necessity of discrete modules in current computational structures is problematic for me and should be addressed in attempts to analyze individual lives through digital methods.</p>

<p>Overall, however, I am still convinced that digital scholarship is worth the risks and offers a chance to investigate historical information in a new light and engage with the larger world in a new way. I look forward to facing again these questions and more with you all in Clio 2.</p>
