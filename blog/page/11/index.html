  <p>I am unsure what to blog about this week. But I thought maybe I would go through my choices for the<a href="http://jeriwieringa.com/portfolio/type.html"> type assignment </a>and give a sense of where I am thinking of taking the design.</p>

<p>My goal for the overall design was to promote readability and to provide a clean, but pleasant framing for the material. The left sidebar contains some of the metadata for the site. My thought here was to make citation as easy as possible, and so both publishing information and the copyright restrictions that Richard set up are visible. I also added some anchor tags to allow for some navigation in the text – this will be easier and more obvious with some of the other texts I am dealing with. Another thought for future iterations is linking to either pdf or epub versions of the text so that the pieces can be downloaded easily.</p>

<p>The background for the site is an image I made (or attempted to make) in Photoshop. I wanted to experiment with a fixed background, so that the page had the effect of only the text moving. The text comes from the Book of Common Prayer, but the ratio between the image and the content is too large to make any sense of the words. I had hoped to make the background faded, but I think I will need to wait until I have a better handle of Photoshop to accomplish that.</p>

<p>The color choice is a desperate attempt to move away from what I have discovered is my obsession with sage. The “dusty rose” effect on the activated links works but is not my favorite. But I do like the background being an off-white. I think it makes the text gentler on the eyes for reading.</p>

<p>I used a variety of fonts for the project. I am using Typekit for the header – the font is Great Primer. The other fonts I downloaded from <a href="http://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/">The League of Moveable Type</a>. I used Fanwood Text for the main text and Sorts Mills Goudy for the titles and everything else. I am happy with Fanwood for the major text sections; it has pleasant spacing and line height.</p>

<p>Overall I am happy with how this has turned out, but of course, I have stared at it so long that I’ve become attached! Any suggestions are welcome!</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I commented on <a href="http://www.historiclove.com/wordpress/2012/02/19/hist-697-font-face/">Claire’s</a> and <a href="http://objectfiles.wordpress.com/2012/02/19/type-assignment-trial-and-error/">Beth’s post</a> this week.</p>

  <p>This week was more of a “big picture” week for me, thus the half step towards the type assignment. I focused most of my “Clio” brain power this week on website organization, on tracking down possible comparison sites for my project, on thinking about layout, and on searching for fonts. Project Canterbury is a very text heavy site and as such my choices in fonts will be particularly noticeable. This also makes my choice a bit complicated, as the font has to both go with the material, which is largely 19th-century documents, and has to be readable on-screen. Thanks to<a href="http://meganrbrett.net/blog/2012/02/h697-seeking-out-new-worlds/"> Megan’s suggestion</a>, I am  looking at fonts from the <a href="http://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/">League of Moveable Type</a>, particularly <a href="http://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/fanwood">Fanwood </a>for more focused reading sections, and <a href="http://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/sorts-mill-goudy">Sorts Mill Goudy</a>. These fonts seem to strike a good balance between referencing the older type of the primary material and being readable on the screen. Now to find a good decorative font to accompany them.</p>

<p>In terms of sites that take on similar projects, I spent some time this week looking at the Willa Cather archive and the Walt Whitman archive. Both of these sites deal with a large amount of text and I found them helpful for organizing my thoughts about what my site needs to accomplish. While both sites have their weaknesses, particularly in terms of design, their approach to organizing the data was particularly helpful.</p>

<p>The resources for this week were helpful in pointing to ways CSS3 gives additional control over the appearance of the site and for pointing to resources for finding and properly calling on fonts. There seem to be a number of resources for creating a well-formatted @font-family stack. It is just a little unfortunate that the lack of standardization results in such a variety of file formats and no guarantee that what we want will appear on the screen of our users. Ah well. Graceful degradation, I believe, is the term for what we want to insure, so at least the site is useable even if IE is determined to have its own way.</p>

<p>On to putting these fonts to work!</p>

  <p>To be honest, typography scares me. I mean, it looks great and I understand why it is important and that you can do many things with typography to make your text interesting. But books on typography seem to enjoy highlighting the numerous ways people use typography poorly or focus on overused and reviled typefaces but rarely explain why (but I like Papyrus…). It is enough to cause me much anxiety. I don’t know enough to avoid the mistakes and end up feeling that it is all rather arbitrary.</p>

<p>Left brain.</p>

<p>However I will attempt to understand this strange new world and will attempt to experiment with type in my next assignments. Just please don’t laugh too loudly at my gaffs.</p>

<p>I do know that the project I will be working on will require a more traditional typography, something that invokes religious copy from the 18th and 19th centuries. I would also, however, like add some tension and flair by adding some more modern layout elements, something to avoid being overly cliche and to add some visual interest to the site.</p>

<p>Another helpful resource for design, particularly if anyone else is painfully analytical and lacking in design sense, is <em>Design for Hackers</em> by David Kadavy. It explains <strong>why</strong> Comic Sans is a problematic font and assumes that design is not your first language. Very helpful for the anxious analytic brain.</p>

<p>Also, the final section in <em>Thinking with Type</em> discussed grids but was very vague about the application of grids to the web. I am interested in experimenting with a grid system for web-design. I have looked at <a href="http://blueprintcss.org/">blueprint</a> and the <a href="http://960.gs/">960 grid system</a> and am leaning toward the 960 grid system. Is anyone interested in experimenting with me?</p>

  <p>So the first iteration of my portfolio is live.</p>

<p>Well, not the first.</p>

<p>More like the 10th.</p>

<p>But the first that I’m willing to go live with.</p>

<p>Some outstanding issues that I am still working on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>getting the sidebar to fill in to equal length with the content section.</li>
  <li>the footer needs to be narrower – but there is something funky with the “badges” that is adding padding or margins.</li>
  <li>manipulating the CSS for the links! This one I am completely stuck on. I’ve tried a couple of things, but they either don’t work, or don’t work like I expect. Also, I would love to have links in the sidebar, but I can’t seem to create separate styling, so both the nav bar and the sidebar links are either black or my background grey. Which means one of them is unintelligible.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can find it at<a href="http://jeriwieringa.com/portfolio/index.html"> jeriwieringa.com/portfolio</a></p>

<p>If you have any ideas or suggestions, please let me know! Also if anyone has IE, could you tell me how it looks? <img src="http://jeriwieringa.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>

<p>*update: apparently I should have watched the typography tutorials earlier – I think the key to different styles for links may be there.</p>

  <!-- use article.summary(250) if you have Nokogiri available to show just

  <p><em>[This post is for week 1 of History and New Media]</em></p>

<p>The readings from today’s class were a helpful reminder that, at the very least, it is as much how you say it as what you say. Content may be king, but if you present your content in a way that is frustrating, illogical, or visually immature, you undermine your content.</p>

<p>From my experience, work done in the humanities is both already very aware of modes of presentation, and also very un-reflective upon those modes of presentation. There is a high value placed on properly formatted footnotes and citation styles, and the format of papers is largely dictated from ‘above’. Those formats are to be transgressed at ones own peril. So while we pay a lot of attention to formatting our work to the academic standards for print, we don’t spend much time thinking about whether those standards are most conducive for presenting our content. And because our standard formats are aimed at print presentations, we are able to get away with not thinking about the connections between content and presentation.</p>

<p>But the web is not print. And the same standard formatting and presentation elements that are acceptable in print are detrimental to web-based content.</p>

<p>This is where digital humanities becomes exciting to me, because it offers a chance to rethink the standard modes for presenting content and, at the same time, offers the opportunity for different types of content to be created and presented.</p>

<p>While all of the readings for this week were interesting and argued for the value of and need for focused attention on design in the creation of web content, the two I found most productive to place in conversation were Donald Norman’s “<a href="http://www.jnd.org/ED_Draft/CH01.pdf">Attractive Things Work Better</a>“[pdf] and the <a href="www.consumerwebwatch.org/dynamic/web-credibility-reports-evaluate-abstract.cfm">Consumer Reports study</a> on how people evaluate a web site’s credibility. If Norman is correct in his description of human mental functions, that we use our cognitive abilities to assign meaning and our affective responses to assign value, we may have a clue as to why people rely upon design to assess credibility. A well designed site puts us at ease and reduces focus, we are less likely to scrutinize the content and are more likely to engage with the content presented. A poorly designed site, according to the same logic, would put the user ill at ease, increase his or her focus, and that user would both be more critical and less receptive to the content being communicated.</p>

<p>On the one hand, while I think that this is plausible, it makes me realize just how gullible or easily rigged the human decision making and value-assigning process is. But that aside, it makes it all the more important that those with strong historical content create sites that are well designed, lest they be dismissed because of their presentation. Just as a paper with sloppy footnotes and formatting is less likely to be taken seriously, so too a website that does not conform to basic principles of design is less likely to be seen as authoritative. So on to learning this new set of presentation guidelines and standards for the world of the web!</p>
