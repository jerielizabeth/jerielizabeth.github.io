  <p>Thanks to Sasha’s kind help, my attempts to display my database values have progress a few baby-steps further.</p>

<p>The “show” page is showing the data from both the person and the text table. Next step is adding the “add author” form under the display of author data and to add a link to “edit” either author or text (or maybe both in one form … thoughts…).</p>

  <!-- use article.summary(250) if you have Nokogiri available to show just

  <p>The idea behind theory week was to pull together a plethora of resources for thinking systematically about both religion and gender, resources that will be used in the upcoming weeks to analyze the historical accounts and will be harnessed for reading texts that do not directly address questions of gender in a gender-focused way.</p>

<p>These texts fall into two general categories (though these overlap and inform one another in, of course, interesting ways): reading from sociology and anthropology, focusing largely on questions of religion but also on questions of social structures, and readings from cultural theory and gender studies that focus on the construction of gender.</p>

<p>One of the largest contrasts I felt in this combination of readings was the tension between the structuralist impulse of the sociologists and the post-structuralist impulse of the gender theorists. Where Durkheim, Turner, and Weber are looking for basic and fundamental structures of human experience, theorists such as Scott, Smith-Rosenberg, and Butler emphasize the contingency and constructed nature of patterns as seemingly basic as gender. I find the idea that gender is not “natural” but constructed and performative to be very persuasive, which makes me even less comfortable with Durkheim’s positing society and the experience of society as the source of religion.</p>

<p>While there is something very interesting about the idea of experience of a collective consciousness as enlightening, empowering, and the rest, it concerns me that his analysis is as tidy as it is. While religion on his account is completely natural and reasonable, it also has very little transcendence. There is some – the experience of the social lifts the individual beyond his/her self – but still, that’s rather horizontal. While Durkheim would respond that he has identified the structure that gives rise to feelings of transcendence and that more elaborate interpretations are just mistaking the experience for something larger, I personally find this explanation/response results in the majority of people being deceived by their religious beliefs. And that is an unappealing place to start from.</p>

<p>Note for Sharon: I have yet to write up a piece for Douglas and Weber. Douglas is just an issue of time – I will get to that shortly. Weber, on the other hand, is defeating me. What is a rational economy? My best guess is that he is referring to objective or disinterested economic relationships. I am not sure what the goal of “Religious Rejections of the World” is.</p>

<p>From what I have gotten from him, it seems that Weber’s theory is aimed at making sense of Protestant (and specifically Calvinist) religious practice where Durkheim is more focused on Catholic (and liturgical) religious practice. Does that sound right?</p>

  <p>Kerber investigates the place of women within the rhetoric and ideology of the Enlightenment. She notes that Enlightenment thinker rarely considered women with theorizing about civic culture and, with a few notable exceptions including Adam Smith, when they did, tended to do so negatively. She argues that women were only considered as wives and mothers, with no mechanism for influencing government. The concept of the “Republican Mother” arose in the American environment as a way to integrate domesticity and politics. In this role, women were “deferential” citizens (59) with limited influence but not strictly excluded. Instead, women remained in a deferential phase of politicization where men in the early republic moved away from deference.</p>

  <p>Kerber’s pieces is an historiographical essay on the concept of “separate sphere” in the telling of women’s history. She identifies 3 stages of the understanding of separate spheres, from the early work of Barbara Welter, Gerda Lerner, and Aileen S. Kraditor that focused on identifying separate spheres as a central theme of women’s experience, through the work of Carroll Smith-Rosenberg and Nancy Cott that focused introduced complexities and the possibilities of women’s culture, to what Kerber identifies as the current 3rd stage that focuses both on how the women’s sphere was “socially constructed both for and by women” and how women’s sphere affected and shaped men’s activities (169-171).</p>

<p>She also notes three characteristics of the 3rd (and current) stage of the use of the metaphor of separate spheres. These are 1) that the concept of “separate spheres” is applicable across the history of human experience, that it’s not just a 19th century phenomena, 2) that it is characterized by more attention to social relations and sees separate spheres as changing response to changing social and economic realities (175) and 3) that attention is being payed to the literal spaces women occupied and shaped.</p>

  <p><em>Gender Trouble</em> is a theoretical inquiry into gender that seeks to open possibilities for the ways gender manifests, or in her terms, is performed, rather than to prescribe a definitive account of what constitutes “gender.” Her work is drawing on the tradition of French philosophy, largely of an anti-structuralist vein, and challenges all foundationalist approaches to questions of gender and persons by arguing that gender is both performed and performative – that gender is something individuals perform and that gender, in the performance, constitutes “the identity it is purported to be” (33). She also challenges the idea that, while gender may be a culturally constructed interpretation, sex is natural and naturally binary. Instead, she argues that sex is also constructed, and constructed through the “apparatus” of gender (11).</p>

<p>This text is very rich in content and very dense in presentation (which Butler brilliantly defends by noting that language itself is not a neutral medium for conveying meaning). Her conclusion for the challenging of gender binaries is both a recognition that no individual can escape the existing framework or power structures (there is no objective outside place from which one can argue), but that those power structures can be challenged and revealed as arbitrary through subversion, through performing gender in such a way that calls attention to the framework’s logic and challenges its status as “natural” and necessary.</p>

  <!-- use article.summary(250) if you have Nokogiri available to show just

  <p>In this essay, Joan Scott traces the uses of “gender” as a category of historical analysis, offering both critiques and positive suggestions about the possibilities for further study. She describes two categories of approaches to gender by historians: the first being descriptive, the second causal. Where descriptive approaches tend to focus on relations between the sexes and largely those outside of the world of politics, causal approaches focus on the creation of gender identifies. These fall into three general trends, each with its own weaknesses:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a focus on the origins of patriarchy. (the focus on patriarchy has the unfortunate consequence of ignoring the connections between gender inequality and other inequality, as well as making gender difference a universal, rather than a cultural construct.)</li>
  <li>a Marxist approach that stresses the material causes of gender difference. (but that very focus on material causes limits the analysis and renders gender the result of economic structures, not an independent category.)</li>
  <li>a post-structuralist approach that seeks to explain the production and reproduction of gendered identity, either of the Anglo-American school focused on object-relations and moral development, or the French school focused on readings of Freud and theories of language (1057). (the Anglo-American school focuses on family and household experiences as the sources for gender construction and needs more attention to symbolic systems, while the French school focuses too heavily on “the subject” which results in positing antagonism between males and females as central to gender and results in reductive readings of the past (1064).)</li>
</ul>

<p>Drawing from all of these approaches and attempting to learn from their weaknesses, Scott poses the following definition of gender as a means of framing gender as a category for analysis. According to Scott, gender is a constitutive element of social relationships based upon perceived difference, which consists of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>culturally available symbols that evoke multiple and contradictory representations of gender,</li>
  <li>normative concepts that set forth interpretations of the meanings of the symbols and limit metaphoric possibilities,</li>
  <li>a notion of politics and reference to social institutions and organizations,</li>
  <li>subjective identity, which needs to be explored in historically contingent ways,</li>
</ul>

<p>as well as the primary way of signifying relationships of power (1067 ff). Where the first point, with its four part points to places for historical investigation, the second – the relationship between gender and power – marks the theorizing about gender (1069).</p>

<p>By focusing on gender in these terms, Scott proposes that historians can better explore both individual subjects and social organizations to understand how gender works and how changes in the construction of gender and power can and do occur (1067).</p>

  <!-- use article.summary(250) if you have Nokogiri available to show just

  <p>Higginbotham’s essay discusses the silence about race and class that has marked much of the theoretical work about gender and the work of feminist scholars. She argues for bringing race into the analysis of power by 1) defining the “construction and ‘technologies’ of race,” 2) exposing race as a metalanguage and 3) revealing race as a site of dialogic exchange and contestation (252). She argues that race is central to the construction of gender, particularly in societies were racial demarcation is basic to social structure (254). Her essay works to explore the concept of race, to unpack the centrality of race in the construction of gender, class and sexuality, and ends by discussing race as “double-voiced discourse,” as both the voice of oppression and of liberation. Her work argues that there is no singular or homogenous experience of women but that race and class both shape and are shaped by conceptions of gender.</p>

  <!-- use article.summary(250) if you have Nokogiri available to show just
       the first 250 characters -->
  <p>Durkheim sets out in <em>Elementary Forms </em> to uncover the truth or reality behind “the religious nature of man”(1). (And in this case, man may be appropriately gendered – it is unclear from the selections I read how women are religious if they are identified with the profane.) His method for addressing this question is to begin with the “simplest and most primitive religion” and to uncover from there the universal structures of religious experience(1). He chooses totemism as his primitive religion and works from the particular practices of Australian Aborigines to the idea of <em>Mana</em>, which is the physical force and moral power undergirding totemic life and, he claims, all religions (201). <em>Mana</em> then is explained as society itself — the social experience is the source for the experience of moral power and collective emotion. That experience is then associated with particular items, and those items become “sacred.”</p>

<p>Some points of note:</p>

<ul>
  <li>He distinguishes “magic” from “religion” by claiming that magic is individual and seeking particular advantage in the world where religion is social, the collective representation of collective realities (9).</li>
  <li>He insists on a sharp dualism between the sacred and the profane, claiming that beliefs divide the world into these two categories and that much of religious practice is maintaining that separation. (Interestingly, it is the sacred that is contagious - the concern seems to be that if everything becomes sacred, nothing is sacred … unsure here).</li>
  <li>In the conclusion, religious practices, or the cult, is described as “the sum total of means by which that faith is created and recreated periodically” (420).</li>
  <li>Durkheim is definitely building upon Kant, particular the his ideas surrounding space/time and his emphasis on the role of morality in religion. Durkheim attributes the source of these things in the social.</li>
  <li>I am unsure, but it seems that the roots for the idea of civil religion can be found here.</li>
</ul>

<p>While I am uncomfortable with Durkheim’s approach (any search for essence makes me nervous) and his goal to explain religion and religious experience in natural and horizontal terms, his descriptions about the power of the social and the experience of the social raise some intriguing questions. There is something very powerful about social gatherings for a single purpose, as seen in the heightened religious experience often recorded at extended revivals. Camp meetings and innovations in religious experiences that come out of them could be explored along these lines.</p>

<p>I am also curious as to where Protestant, and particularly Calvinist, religious practice fits into Durkheim’s scheme. It is unclear to me where a religion that insists on the sacredness of all labor and the everyday would fit when sacred and profane are described as opposing and needing to be kept separate.</p>

  <!-- use article.summary(250) if you have Nokogiri available to show just

  <p>In this essay, Smith-Rosenberg investigates the structure of radical religious movements, movements that challenge the prevailing social order. Her primary example is the religious revivals of the 19th century and her main focus is on explaining why these movements seem to be especially appealing to women.</p>

<p>She refers to movements such as these as periods of “religious anti-ritualism,” a concept she develops from the work of Mary Douglas. She notes that periods of anti-ritualism tend to correspond with periods of social change and can be understood as a “social language” to express social experiences (137-9).</p>

<p>To answer the question of why women were particularly attracted to religious anti-ritualism, Smith-Rosenberg draws on the theoretical work of Victor Turner and the structure of “rites of passage” that he identifies. She identifies periods of revival as periods of disorder between systems of order, while acknowledging that these had their own ritualistic form. She describes them as “liminal” periods, as periods where roles and power are renegotiated and when those on the margins of society are able to claim some amount of power. Women, she argues, are always marginal, and so find anti-revivalism more appealing and often remain in the anti-revival mode longer than others.</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/2012/09/20/carroll-smith-rosenberg-female-world-of-love-and-ritual.html">Carroll Smith-Rosenberg, &#8220;Female World of Love and Ritual&#8221;</a> <span>Sep 20</span></h2>
  <!-- use article.summary(250) if you have Nokogiri available to show just

  <p>Smith-Rosenberg investigates the ways sexuality was constructed in the 19th century and particularly at the relationships between women. She describes a world that is largely homosocial, where the primary relationships for each gender was located among others of the same gender. These relationships were both intimate and socially acceptable, fitting with no apparent contradiction with the societal push for women to assume roles as wives and mothers.</p>

<p>While this description seems connected to the idea of “separate spheres,” the idea that men and women had distinct social sphere raises some interesting questions. For one, it would be interesting to look at conversion patterns in terms of these homosocial networks, rather than families. Also, the discussion of female social worlds needs a corresponding discussion of male social worlds and the prevalence of fraternal societies during this period.</p>

<p>Just as a side note, Smith-Rosenberg seems to describe this sort of social relationship as a world long past. However, it is interesting to note that I have seen similar patterns, though less intense, in conservative evangelical subcultures where interactions across the genders is highly regulated.</p>
