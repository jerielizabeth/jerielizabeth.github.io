  <h2><a href="/blog/2012/11/04/short-tutorial-cleaning-up-downloaded-files-draft.html">Short Tutorial: Cleaning up downloaded files (draft)</a> <span>Nov  4</span></h2>
  <!-- use article.summary(250) if you have Nokogiri available to show just
       the first 250 characters -->
  <p>So you used wget or Python to pull down a collection of files from the web. Excellent! But in looking through your loot, you notice that a number of the files are oddly small and, on further examination, find that they are functionally empty. How do you clean up your collection of files quickly?</p>

<p>There are a number of very powerful command line tools built into UNIX systems (Mac and Linux) that allow you to manipulate your files quickly and easily. This is a brief tutorial on how to use those tools to locate all of the files that are too small and then remove those files from your collection.</p>

<p>Begin by navigating in Terminal to your collection of folders. For example, my files were located a couple of folders downs within my Documents folder.</p>

<pre>cd Documents/Github/Clio3/Webscraping/hymn-files</pre>

<p>Once in the folder with your downloaded files, you need to find a way to isolate out the files that are too small to be interesting. To do this, use the “find” command. First, to see the various options associated with “find”, enter</p>

<pre>man help</pre>

<p>Use the up and down arrows to move around the window that appears. Look around at the various options – there are many! However, because we are looking only in a particular folder, which in my case has no subfolders, all that we need to look at for now is size.</p>

<p>To exit this window, type “q”.</p>

<p>If the files we are interested in sorting through are all one file type (in my case they’re .json files), we can tell the computer to find all of the files of a particular type and particular size as follows:</p>

<pre>find *.json -size 28c</pre>

<p>This would find all of the json files that are 28 bytes in size.</p>

<p>However, we want all the files that are 28 bytes or less.</p>

<pre>find *.json -size -28c</pre>

<p>Finding the files is great, but now we need to do something with that collection of files.</p>

<p>First we are going to “pipe” the results of our search over to our second, removal, function.</p>

<p>(From here on the examples are showing how the command is built – Do not run the command until the very end when all the pieces are in place)</p>

<pre>find *.json -size -28c |</pre>

<p>Next we are going to use xargs, which helps the computer handle a long list of file names.</p>

<p>Note: The wikipedia entry on xargs suggests using “-0″ (zero) when dealing with file names with spaces in them as xargs defaults to separating at white space (another reason to avoid spaces in filenames). If you run this command without -0 and it doesn’t work, try adding the -0.</p>

<pre>find *.json -size -28c | xargs</pre>

<p>And the function we want to run on each filename is “rm” or remove. rm has a number of options that you can research, some of which really make data un-recoverable and should be used with care. However, a basic “rm” command will be sufficient for this example.</p>

<pre>find *.json -size -28c | xargs rm</pre>

<p>Run this command to remove all of the files less than 28 bytes from your current directory.</p>

<p>(I used 28 bytes because the computer was having trouble with 0 and all of the files I wanted to keep were larger than 28 bytes. Not exactly sure why 0 was a problem but this is why experimenting with the find options before moving on to removing the files is a good idea!)</p>

<h2 id="what-is-beautiful-soup">What is Beautiful Soup?</h2>

<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>

<p>“You didn’t write that awful page. You’re just trying to get some data out of it. Beautiful Soup is here to help.” (<a href="http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/">Opening lines of Beautiful Soup</a>) Beautiful Soup is a Python library for getting data out of HTML, XML, and other markup languages. Say you’ve found some webpages that display data relevant to your research, such as date or address information, but that do not provide any way of downloading the data directly. Beautiful Soup helps you pull particular content from a webpage, remove the HTML markup, and save the information. It is a tool for web scraping that helps you clean up and parse the documents you have pulled down from the web. The <a href="http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/">Beautiful Soup documentation</a> will give you a sense of variety of things that the Beautiful Soup library will help with, from isolating titles and links, to extracting all of the text from the html tags, to altering the HTML within the document you’re working with.</p>

<h3 id="installing-beautiful-soup">Installing Beautiful Soup</h3>

<p>Installing Beautiful Soup is easiest if you have pip or another Python installer already in place. If you don’t have pip, run through a quick tutorial on <a href="http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/installing-pip-and-beautiful-soup">installing both pip and Beautiful Soup</a> to get it running. Once you have pip installed, run the following command in the terminal to install Beautiful Soup:</p>

<pre class="brush: plain; title: ; notranslate" title="">pip install beautifulsoup4</pre>

<p>You may need to preface this line with “sudo”, which gives your computer permission to write to your root directories and requires you to re-enter your password. This is the same logic behind you being prompted to enter your password when you install a new program. With sudo, the command is:</p>

<pre class="brush: plain; title: ; notranslate" title="">sudo pip install beautifulsoup4</pre>

<h3 id="preview-where-we-are-going">Preview: Where we are going</h3>

<p>Because I like to see where the finish line is before starting, I will begin with a view of what we are trying to create. We are attempting to go from a search results page where the html page looks like this:</p>

<pre class="brush: plain; title: ; notranslate" title="">&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;table border="1" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="3"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=A000035"&gt;ADAMS, George Madison&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1837-1920&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=A000074"&gt;ALBERT, William Julian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;</pre>

<p>to a CSV file with names and urls that looks like this:</p>

<pre>"ADAMS, George Madison",http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=A000035
"ALBERT, William Julian",http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=A000074
"ALBRIGHT, Charles",http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=A000077</pre>

<p>using a Python script like this:</p>

<pre class="brush: python; title: ; notranslate" title="">from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import csv
 
soup = BeautifulSoup (open("43rd-congress.html"))
 
final_link = soup.p.a
final_link.decompose()
 
f = csv.writer(open("43rd_Congress.csv", "w"))
f.writerow(["Name", "Link"])    # Write column headers as the first line
 
links = soup.find_all('a')
for link in links:
    names = link.contents[0]
    fullLink = link.get('href')
 
    f.writerow([names,fullLink])
</pre>

<p>This tutorial explains to how to assemble the final code.</p>

<h3 id="get-a-webpage-to-scrape">Get a webpage to scrape</h3>

<p>The first step is getting a copy of the HTML page(s) want to scrape. You can combine BeautifulSoup with <a href="http://urllib3.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">urllib3</a> to work directly with pages on the web. This tutorial, however, focuses on using BeautifulSoup with local (downloaded) copies of html files. The Congressional database that we’re using is not an easy one to scrape because the URL for the search results remains the same regardless of what you’re searching for. While this can be bypassed programmatically, it is easier for our purposes to go to <a href="http://bioguide.congress.gov/biosearch/biosearch.asp" target="_blank">http://bioguide.congress.gov/biosearch/biosearch.asp</a>, search for Congress number 43, and to save a copy of the results page.</p>

</div>

<p>Selecting “File” and “Save Page As …” from your browser window will accomplish this (life will be easier if you avoid using spaces in your filename). I have used “43rd-congress.html”. Move the file into the folder you want to work in. (To learn how to automate the downloading of HTML pages using Python, see <a href="http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/automated-downloading-with-wget">Automated Downloading with Wget</a> and <a href="http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/downloading-multiple-records-using-query-strings">Downloading Multiple Records Using Query Strings</a>.)</p>

<h3 id="identify-content">Identify content</h3>

<p>One of the first things Beautiful Soup can help us with is locating content that is buried within the HTML structure. Beautiful Soup allows you to select content based upon tags (example: soup.body.p.b finds the first bold item inside a paragraph tag inside the body tag in the document). To get a good view of how the tags are nested in the document, we can use the method “prettify” on our soup object. Create a new text file called “soupexample.py” in the same location as your downloaded HTML file. This file will contain the Python script that we will be developing over the course of the tutorial. To begin, import the Beautiful Soup library, open the HTML file and pass it to Beautiful Soup, and then print the “pretty” version in the terminal.</p>

<pre class="brush: python; title: ; notranslate" title="">from bs4 import BeautifulSoup soup = BeautifulSoup(open("43rd-congress.html")) print(soup.prettify()) </pre>

<p>Save “soupexample.py” in the folder with your HTML file and go to the command line. Navigate (use ‘cd’) to the folder you’re working in and execute the following:</p>

<pre class="brush: plain; title: ; notranslate" title="">python soupexample.py</pre>

<p>You should see your terminal window fill up with a nicely indented version of the original html text (see Figure 3). This is a visual representation of how the various tags relate to one another.</p>

</div>

<h3 id="using-beautifulsoup-to-select-particular-content">Using BeautifulSoup to select particular content</h3>

<p>Remember that we are interested in only the names and URLs of the various member of the 43rd Congress. Looking at the ”pretty” version of the file, the first thing to notice is that the data we want is not too deeply embedded in the HTML structure. Both the names and the URLs are, most fortunately, embedded in “<a>” tags. So, we need to isolate out all of the “<a>” tags. We can do this by updating the code in “soupexample.py” to the following:</a></a></p>

<pre class="brush: python; highlight: [5,7,8]; title: ; notranslate" title="">from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

soup = BeautifulSoup (open("43rd-congress.html"))

links = soup.find_all('a')

for link in links:
    print link
</pre>

<p>Save and run the script again to see all of the anchor tags in the document.</p>

<pre class="brush: plain; title: ; notranslate" title="">python soupexample.py</pre>

<p>One thing to notice is that there is an additional link in our file – the link for an additional search.</p>

<div id="attachment_2112" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 310px">
  <a href="http://programminghistorian.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Beautiful-Soup-Tutorial-—-bash-—-101×26-2013-08-23-13-25-56.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2112" alt="Figure 4: The URLs and names, plus one addition." src="http://programminghistorian.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Beautiful-Soup-Tutorial-—-bash-—-101×26-2013-08-23-13-25-56-300x164.jpg" width="300" height="164" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">
    Figure 4: The URLs and names, plus one addition
  </p>
</div>

<p>We can get rid of this with just a few lines of code. Going back to the pretty version, notice that this last “<a>” tag is not within the table but is within a “&lt;p&gt;” tag.</a></p>

<div id="attachment_2111" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 310px">
  <a href="http://programminghistorian.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Beautiful-Soup-Tutorial-—-bash-—-103×40-2013-08-23-13-23-07.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2111" alt="Figure 4: The rogue link" src="http://programminghistorian.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Beautiful-Soup-Tutorial-—-bash-—-103×40-2013-08-23-13-23-07-300x242.jpg" width="300" height="242" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">

  </p>
</div>

<p>Because Beautiful Soup allows us to modify the HTML, we can remove the “<a>” that is under the “&lt;p&gt;” before searching for all the “<a>” tags. To do this, we can use the “decompose” method, which removes the specified content from the “soup”. Do be careful when using “decompose”—you are deleting both the HTML tag and all of the data inside of that tag. If you have not correctly isolated the data, you may be deleting information that you wanted to extract. Update the file as below and run again.</a></a></p>

<pre class="brush: python; highlight: [5,6]; title: ; notranslate" title="">from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

soup = BeautifulSoup (open("43rd-congress.html"))

final_link = soup.p.a
final_link.decompose()

links = soup.find_all('a')

for link in links:
    print link
</pre>

<div id="attachment_2113" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 310px">
  <a href="http://programminghistorian.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Beautiful-Soup-Tutorial-—-bash-—-101×26-2013-08-23-13-28-04.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2113" alt="Figure 6: Successfully isolated only names and URLs" src="http://programminghistorian.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Beautiful-Soup-Tutorial-—-bash-—-101×26-2013-08-23-13-28-04-300x164.jpg" width="300" height="164" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">
    Figure 6: Successfully isolated only names and URLs

<p>Success! We have isolated out all of the links we want and none of the links we don’t!</p>

<h3 id="stripping-tags-and-writing-content-to-a-csv-file">Stripping Tags and Writing Content to a CSV file</h3>

<p>But, we are not done yet! There are still HTML tags surrounding the URL data that we want. And we need to save the data into a file in order to use it for other projects. In order to clean up the HTML tags and split the URLs from the names, we need to isolate the information from the anchor tags. To do this, we will use two powerful, and commonly used Beautiful Soup methods: contents and get. Where before we told the computer to print each link, we now want the computer to separate the link into its parts and print those separately. For the names, we can use link.contents. The “contents” method isolates out the text from within html tags. For example, if you started with</p>

<pre>&lt;h2&gt;This is my Header text&lt;/h2&gt;</pre>

<p>you would be left with “This is my Header text” after applying the contents method. In this case, we want the contents inside the first tag in “link”. (There is only one tag in “link”, but since the computer doesn’t realize that, we must tell it to use the first tag.) For the URL, however, “contents” does not work because the URL is part of the HTML tag. Instead, we will use “get”, which allow us to pull the text associated with (is on the other side of the “=” of) the “href” element.</p>

<pre class="brush: python; highlight: [10,11,12,13]; title: ; notranslate" title="">from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

soup = BeautifulSoup (open("43rd-congress.html"))

final_link = soup.p.a
final_link.decompose()

links = soup.find_all('a')
for link in links:
    names = link.contents[0]
    fullLink = link.get('href')
    print names
    print fullLink
</pre>

<div id="attachment_2114" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 310px">
  <a href="http://programminghistorian.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Beautiful-Soup-Tutorial-—-bash-—-101×26-2013-08-23-14-13-13.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2114" alt="Figure 7: All HTML tags have been removed" src="http://programminghistorian.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Beautiful-Soup-Tutorial-—-bash-—-101×26-2013-08-23-14-13-13-300x164.jpg" width="300" height="164" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">
    Figure 7: All HTML tags have been removed
  </p>
</div>

<p>Finally, we want to use the CSV library to write the file. First, we need to import the CSV library into the script with “import csv.” Next, we create the new CSV file when we “open” it using “csv.writer”. The “w” tells the computer to “write” to the file. And to keep everything organized, let’s write some column headers. Finally, as each line is processed, the name and URL information is written to our CSV file.</p>

<pre class="brush: python; highlight: [2,9,10,14,15,17]; title: ; notranslate" title="">from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import csv

soup = BeautifulSoup (open("43rd-congress.html"))

final_link = soup.p.a
final_link.decompose()

f = csv.writer(open("43rd_Congress.csv", "w"))
f.writerow(["Name", "Link"]) # Write column headers as the first line

links = soup.find_all('a')
for link in links:
    names = link.contents[0]
    fullLink = link.get('href')

    f.writerow([names, fullLink])
</pre>

<p>When executed, this gives us a clean CSV file that we can then use for other purposes.</p>

<div id="attachment_2115" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 310px">
  <a href="http://programminghistorian.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/43rd_Congress-2-2013-08-23-14-18-27.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2115" alt="Figure 8: CSV file of results" src="http://programminghistorian.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/43rd_Congress-2-2013-08-23-14-18-27-300x125.jpg" width="300" height="125" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">

<p>We have solved our puzzle and have extracted names and URLs from the HTML file.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="but-wait-what-if-i-want-all-of-the-data">But wait! What if I want ALL of the data?</h2>

<p>Let’s extend our project to capture all of the data from the webpage. We know all of our data can be found inside a table, so let’s use “&lt;tr&gt;” to isolate the content that we want.</p>

<pre class="brush: python; highlight: [8,9,10]; title: ; notranslate" title="">from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

soup = BeautifulSoup (open("43rd-congress.html"))

final_link = soup.p.a
final_link.decompose()

trs = soup.find_all('tr')
for tr in trs:
    print tr
</pre>

<p>Looking at the print out in the terminal, you can see we have selected a lot more content than when we searched for “<a>” tags. Now we need to sort through all of these lines to separate out the different types of data.</a></p>

    Figure 8: All of the Table Row data
  </p>
</div>

<h3 id="extracting-the-data">Extracting the Data</h3>

<p>We can extract the data in two moves. First, we will isolate the link information; then, we will parse the rest of the table row data. For the first, let’s create a loop to search for all of the anchor tags and “get” the data associated with “href”.</p>

<pre class="brush: python; highlight: [12,13,14]; title: ; notranslate" title="">from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

soup = BeautifulSoup (open("43rd-congress.html"))

final_link = soup.p.a
final_link.decompose()

trs = soup.find_all('tr')

for tr in trs:
    for link in tr.find_all('a'):
        fulllink = link.get ('href')
        print fulllink #print in terminal to verify results
</pre>

<p>We then need to run a search for the table data within the table rows. (The “print” here allows us to verify that the code is working but is not necessary.)</p>

<pre class="brush: python; highlight: [15,16]; title: ; notranslate" title="">from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

soup = BeautifulSoup (open("43rd-congress.html"))

final_link = soup.p.a
final_link.decompose()

trs = soup.find_all('tr')

for tr in trs:
    for link in tr.find_all('a'):
        fulllink = link.get ('href')
        print fulllink #print in terminal to verify results

    tds = tr.find_all("td")
    print tds
</pre>

<p>Next, we need to extract the data we want. We know that everything we want for our CSV file lives within table data (“td”) tags. We also know that these items appear in the same order within the row. Because we are dealing with lists, we can identify information by its position within the list. This means that the first data item in the row is identified by [0], the second by <a href="http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/intro-to-beautiful-soup">1</a>, etc. Because not all of the rows contain the same number of data items, we need to build in a way to tell the script to move on if it encounters an error. This is the logic of the “try” and “except” block. If a particular line fails, the script will continue on to the next line.</p>

<pre class="brush: python; highlight: [17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29]; title: ; notranslate" title="">from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

soup = BeautifulSoup (open("43rd-congress.html"))

final_link = soup.p.a
final_link.decompose()

trs = soup.find_all('tr')

for tr in trs:
    for link in tr.find_all('a'):
        fulllink = link.get ('href')
        print fulllink #print in terminal to verify results

    tds = tr.find_all("td")

    try: #we are using "try" because the table is not well formatted. This allows the program to continue after encountering an error.
        names = str(tds[0].get_text()) # This structure isolate the item by its column in the table and converts it into a string.
        years = str(tds[1].get_text())
        positions = str(tds[2].get_text())
        parties = str(tds[3].get_text())
        states = str(tds[4].get_text())
        congress = tds[5].get_text()

    except:
        print "bad tr string"
        continue #This tells the computer to move on to the next item after it encounters an error

    print names, years, positions, parties, states, congress
</pre>

<p>Within this we are using the following structure:</p>

<pre class="brush: python; title: ; notranslate" title="">years = str(tds[1].get_text())</pre>

<p>We are applying the “get_text” method to the 2nd element in the row (because computers count beginning with 0) and creating a string from the result. This we assign to the variable “years”, which we will use to create the CSV file. We repeat this for every item in the table that we want to capture in our file.</p>

<h3 id="writing-the-csv-file">Writing the CSV file</h3>

<p>The last step in this file is to create the CSV file. Here we are using the same process as we did in Part I, just with more variables. As a result, our file will look like:</p>

<pre class="brush: python; highlight: [2,9,10,32]; title: ; notranslate" title="">from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import csv

soup = BeautifulSoup (open("43rd-congress.html"))

final_link = soup.p.a
final_link.decompose()

f= csv.writer(open("43rd_Congress_all.csv", "w"))   # Open the output file for writing before the loop
f.writerow(["Name", "Years", "Position", "Party", "State", "Congress", "Link"]) # Write column headers as the first line

trs = soup.find_all('tr')

for tr in trs:
    for link in tr.find_all('a'):
        fullLink = link.get ('href')

    tds = tr.find_all("td")

    try: #we are using "try" because the table is not well formatted. This allows the program to continue after encountering an error.
        names = str(tds[0].get_text()) # This structure isolate the item by its column in the table and converts it into a string.
        years = str(tds[1].get_text())
        positions = str(tds[2].get_text())
        parties = str(tds[3].get_text())
        states = str(tds[4].get_text())
        congress = tds[5].get_text()

    except:
        print "bad tr string"
        continue #This tells the computer to move on to the next item after it encounters an error

    f.writerow([names, years, positions, parties, states, congress, fullLink])
</pre>

<p>You’ve done it! You have created a CSV file from all of the data in the table, creating useful data from the confusion of the html page.</p>

  <p>So I’ve been working on text-mining all week and that has generally gone very well.</p>

<p>I am a little less confident on the libraries used to create visualizations from text-mining results using python. The main one I have seen referenced is <a href="http://matplotlib.org/1.1.1/">matplotlab</a>, which is slightly intimidating and feels more science/math focused.</p>

<p>Are there python libraries that humanities types use for visualizations? Are other languages/programs preferred? How do you create the graphical representation of your humanities data?</p>

<p>(I may be jumping ahead a bit here, but I have this list of word frequencies and it feels sad to leave it as a list.)</p>

  <!-- use article.summary(250) if you have Nokogiri available to show just

  <p>Terryl L. Givens, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">People of Paradox: A History of Mormon Culture</span></p>

<ul>
  <li>Givens approaches the study of Mormon culture by focusing first on what he describes as five major tensions within Mormon thoughts (authority vs. individualism, searching vs. certitude, disintegration of sacred distance, exile vs. integration, American vs. universal) and then looking at how those tensions play out in the cultural arenas of intellectual thought, architectures, music, theater, literature, and visual (fine) art. He identifies 1890 (the official end of polygamy) as a division point between two phases of cultural development and both insists on and argues for Mormonism as a particularly American religion.</li>
</ul>

<p>Lawrence Foster, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Women, Family and Utopia: Communal Experiments of the Shakers, the Oneida Community, and the Mormons</span>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Foster is expanding his earlier work on religion and sexuality. He argues for studying groups who offer a more radical reaction to social reorganization by claiming that their responses reveal the general tensions and issues, that they are carrying the logic of the possible solutions to their conclusions and so, with careful reading, allow us to see those more general patterns. He focuses on questions of how these groups understood themselves, looking less to explain them or determine their success than to draw attention to how they constructed their world and what problems that construction sought to address. His conclusion offers an excellent summary of his major points for each group.</li>
</ul>

<p>—————-</p>

<p>This weeks readings were both interesting and a little disappointing. We knew going in that there needed to be some reading against the text — secondary literature on women in Mormonism is relatively non-existent and that which is focuses largely on the polygamy issue.</p>

<p>After reading the introduction to Givens’ book, the general scarcity of women in his analysis makes sense – it is a structural consequence of his definitional choices. His analysis focuses on the more systematic and often more male-driven aspects of culture — the thought systems, the creation of fine art, etc — areas where there is female influence, but that is generally speaking dominantly male. As a result, areas of popular culture, like crafts and vernacular arts, household decorations, art that offers a glimpse of one aspect of women’s culture, is left outside of the analysis. Also, his choice to focus primarily on art created for religious purposes makes it more difficult for him to find the types of creative tensions he is looking for.</p>

<p>In addition, it is not clear to me that the tensions and paradoxes described by Givens’ are particular to the Latter-Day Saints. While they are resolved in particular and often inventive ways, the five tensions he describes can just as easily describe many if not every other branch of Christian thought and practice.</p>

<p>Foster’s approach in his analysis is closer to what I hope to do in mine, in that he attempts to understand these movement on their own terms. He, however, is focused on the social aspects of the imagination at play in these communities much more than the religious aspects, although these are very mutually informing. Style and repetition concerns aside, it is a very useful book for starting to look at these communities in terms of their own internal logic and goals.</p>

<p>One major weakness in both of these works is the general silence on questions of race and class. This is particularly noticeable in Foster, in that a discussion of the construction of gender without these problematic. Givens looks less at gender, but his ability to deal with questions of race and class is also hampered by his choice to identify culture in ways that make those questions less apparent.</p>

<p>Coming out of these readings, there are a couple of themes that I am seeing repeated across the works that might provide interesting starting points for my own analysis. First, is the anxiety over interpretation and salvation that seems to be growing with the emphasis on individual authority over interpretation and the necessity of sure knowledge/experience of salvation. Second, and related, is the collapse of sacred distance. This one is a bit more complicated than Givens’ goes into – while he uses this to denote the breakdown between the categories of sacred and secular in Mormonism, with men becoming gods and God becoming like men, I am more interested in the reaching for connection with the divine, the efforts to bridge the distance between sacred and secular and to increase the experience of the sacred. Third, and again related, is the search for a sure experience, for something known and undoubtable. This type of search has parallels in the philosophical works of the day and while searching for assurance is well documented in studies of Puritan New England, there appears to be a particular crisis of knowledge being reacted against. And fourth is the primitivist impulse, the desire to go back to some unpolluted point and to recreate the world based upon that pure model.</p>

  <p>So, this week was both productive and not. I find that I learn in circles – I have to go over things about 3 times for connections between things to get to the point that I feel like I have learned something. (They told us this in philosophy too –  read it 3 times to understand what is going on. Now, if they assigned the same thing 3 times …)</p>

<p>Anyway, in light of this pattern, I went back to some tutorials. I spent too much time on the first 17 tutorials of “<a href="http://learnpythonthehardway.org/">Learn Python the Hard Way</a>” and then, because I got a bit distractable at that point, did the first 13 of “<a href="http://sql.learncodethehardway.org/">Learn SQL the Hard Way</a>.” (I have a feeling <a href="http://regex.learncodethehardway.org/book/">“Learn Regex…”</a> is in my future …)</p>

<p>At any rate, the SQL tutorials were really helpful in a, “well, duh. I should’ve picked up on that” sort of way. So I tweaked my pages to have one query for showing both text and author information, which is super useful and makes everything much cleaner and less confusing. I’ll push that up to my server so to update <a href="http://clio3.jeriwieringa.com">clio3.jeriwieringa.com</a>.</p>

<p>There is still more to do with that, but I got distracted again by all of the files I pulled down last week. (seriously, grad school is turning me into a goldfish… ) At any rate, there was a small problem that most of the 2000 files that I pulled down were 2 bytes large. (they contained an empty array).</p>

<p>So, with much googling, I worked out a bash script to delete all of the really small files. yup.</p>

<pre>find *.json -size -28c | xargs rm</pre>

<p>I was in folder already so no file path necessary. Anyway, this deleted all of the files that ended with .json and were smaller than 28 bytes. I tried with 2 bytes, but it was hiccup-ing.</p>

<p>Then I realized I needed to parse out the hymnal IDs so I know which hymnal information to add to my database. (Good news – there is place info in the hymnal CSV file. It’s not going to tell me all that much, but it’s enough to get a sense of where the publishing centers are. And it gives me something to map.) And that’s where I’ve slowed to a halt.</p>

<p>I am having trouble getting my head around working with these json files. I know it’s been explained to me many times, and I know it’s an array of arrays, but I just can’t seem to find a basic intro to the syntax for working with it. So that is where I could use the most help this week.</p>
